Edwards and I want to read the dedication real quick for mum dad and pycraft my first and best teachers and person-to-person sales one frame at a time for my wife Terri who always believed in my sails abilities even when the whole world seem not to care for but Daniels my first professor in the sales life in a Russell Brand since you showed me that people buy you as much as they buy your product I had a better product why were people buying mine instead of theirs as idea after idea flat I started to realise that it wasn't a product that made a company successful it was the company's ability to create a strong enough Desire for that product that the customer would you anything to buy aka sales copywriting that was the key eventually I gave in and started the study good copy learn how to write good copy none of those things matter because the products I tried to sell didn't sell the traffic I tried to drive didn't convert the funnels I built didn't persuade people to buy when I was set where I was selling copyright is what made me rich it is the great amplifier it has more impact on how much money you make with your company than anything else you know it's became a partner of mine if you years ago when he looked at the mission we had a clickfunnels to help free all entrepreneurs you call me one day and do you want to know how you can make all of your customers more successful true story that's exactly what I did I said I asked him how and he responded you need to help them write better copy when you're copying proves they will sell more stuff do that funnels and they'll stay with clickfunnels forever even if they have no idea what they're doing and watch this tool has helped people who have never had success online to finally generate leads make money and find success when he started on this book last year he told me that is go wants to help more people to master copywriting that was married to order but if anybody could I knew gym work in the right-hand this book will help you to make more money during this life Russell Branson co-founder clickfunnels infernal script nothing add-on that one's do or we go pre-selling gravesites which meant trying to sell grave plot door-to-door in Hampton Virginia to people who were dead yet you name it I tried selling it everything commented when I became a mortgage broker that was the start later I created a program on hand ripped off when you got a mortgage because I've seen a lot of people ripped off by mortgage brokers and also read a book on how to sell your house yourself obviously since you're reading this one one of the best things you can do is read any sales message that hit that get you to spend money that is cover copy you should study because you connected with it on an emotional level but we'll talk more about this later one thing to know to my recollection I have never written sales copy for anybody else only for my product I realised early on that nobody could sell my stuff that other than I could also when I first started selling online I couldn't afford the hire someone to write a sales letter for me so I had to learn how to do it myself the first website I ever wanted had something like 20 pages on it I had no clue what I was doing then I was exposed to the idea of a long form one page sales letter where people came and scroll down a single page with a giant cells pitch so I can read that 20 page website into a one-page sales letter now if you print it now it might have pages long but it was one page on the website overnight mysales when a 250 percent that's when I clicked with me that hey if you want to make more money writing good sales copy is the key it didn't have anything to do with getting more traffic it had everything to do with how well I was able to make myself picture over the web over the years I've written sells letters down over 3 million dollars and sales another one that did two-and-a-half another one that did a million and a half a $29 product I recently had another Funnel break the 10 million-dollar Mark by the way you have to sell a lot of stuff at 29 Baxter Park to make a moon and a half box here's the big thing to remember nobody will write better copy for your stuff than you how to connect with your audience it takes time to learn how to write copy from scratch but it's worth it the cool thing is nobody is born a million-dollar copywriter nobody is born knowing the exact words to use for sales copy but unlike a fiction writer or even a non-fiction writing sales copy flowers patterns that you can learn you can use and adapt those proven patterns to quickly create copy that sells it's the fastest type of riding you can learn and it's also the most profitable nice to before we get into the first secret any clarification or thoughts that we need to to bring to the reader or listener or you know other than just where do you get the idea of the one-page sales letter I saw other people doing it so he got me to spend money and initially people always have the reaction to the one-page sales letter which will talk about later in the book but that's brilliant that a lot more than that but the thing is the funny thing is that people look at 1 pixels orders and they say oh my god that is so long now but whatever read that and that's a stupid thing to say because people real read them the right people will read them in the right people will buy from that I don't care if you don't read myself wetter if you're not interested in my tablet I do care secret number one what is copywriting I've got a really amazing quote for you to start this one by a really smart person sales copywriting is anything intended to persuade the right reader view or listener to take a specific action Jim Edwards good when you call yourself here's my definition of copywriting sales copywriting is anything intended to persuade the right rear view or listener to take a specific action take a moment to think about this you won't your reader view or listener to take a specific action whether online or offline the specific actions you want undertake include clicking a link making an enquiry for more information buying something or going to the next step in your sales process with sales copy you're trying to get someone to click a by Joanna form buy something online or through the mail maybe you want them to pick up the phone and I'll phone number or even physical location such as a store this is not rocket science what makes copy running different from Regular writing less than you think most people believe happy rang is a different way of thinking and writing it's a very distinct with specific partners sometimes these people are right other times they're completely wrong from my experience the best copywriting occurs when people don't realise it's car because it's interesting to them I used to read sales letters that came in the mail otherwise known as free reports it's funny to think the back in the day you would request a free report it was nothing but a 1020 or 30 plate sales letter is there fears it speaks to their desires it uses words that they use it feels like a conversation with a friend or a trusted advisor I think a lot of people also believe sales can't be as something that magically makes people do what they wouldn't ordinarily do the reality is that people love to buy stuff when you say that again the reality is that people love to buy stuff that's why everybody has hellacious credit card bill that's why everybody has made Amazon the number one site in the world to buy stuff people love to buy do I want someone to do as a result of Reading watching or listening to what I've traded with that in mind sales copy can be achieved it can be an article it can be a concert video it can be a Facebook live video it can be a meme with me anything you put in front of a target that you put down you in front of them then you invite them to take the next step which is the by the stuff they want to buy anyway or to sign up for stop whatever it is they want to do that you're trying to help him do that the purpose of yourself how much has the outer signs of copywriting changed over the years in the there's a graphic that shows a reprint of the 1900 sales catalogue from Sears and Roebuck the picture in the book actually was the catalogue Ashley was reprinted in 1970 that's why it says 3 hours and 95% people have been buying stars who invented before that people bothered the way people talk has changed maybe now for the better if you've been to a local mall and listen to teenagers talking with no adult supervising that's why the end of the day when you're drained you say things like that where are we going to talk about here in this particular area as far as business that's the way people used to people are that way anymore when it comes to car be riding yard dispense with a lot of the warm instead you grab them get their attention with Curiosity and then drive them to the point that you're trying to and how has copywriting stayed the same they're going to be because you can communicate better with understand your neutron what's talk about your neck when people talk about their copywriting writing as and targeting they talk about their niche but most people talk about numbers they speak out psychographics are demographics often they forget the people in the niche actually are the niche you need to understand the people it's good to know the numbers and all that other stuff but you need to understand that people the person the individuals in your net when we talk about your Avatar all these things are important them in you need to know what's important to them because you're selling to people you're not selling to a niche in copywriting there's no prize for second place your copy either works or you start there was gonna say that again your car be either works or you start then I was coming like a smack in the mouth you make any money when someone says hey great sells hey I love you really that's nice to hear but unfortunately that doesn't spend you make money when you're the one who gets people to click buying after that you know go halfway with your car you don't do something just to see what happens in baby it will work you put for the strong ever every single time they are tools like Funnel scripts that can help you with that there are tools like my wizards that can help you with that the bottom line is you've got to be it's about this you can just doing 8:30 because if you do you're only going to get a half past results attention typically with a headline or statement with a question anyway you're running ads it's a picture that makes people go what is that and he'll be given to staff so can you find that some of the better attention grabbers and I know this is different with all cases and all products and or services being sold start like the lines of that sells copy is a question or a really strong statement typically whatever it is that stands people is the very first thing that they say so it's it can be a question in the form of a headliner can be I just had mine in the form of a headline but the important thing is it's the first thing that people see I give credit where credit is due in and Russell brunson talks about he imagines people sitting on the toilet at home with their phone in their hand scrolling through stuff and he's trying to figure out make them stop scrolling and if you think about it I mean me personally I'm nothing is off limits do we can do it everyone doing this I'll tell you that's what I do all my reading on the news is sitting on the couch in Whatsapp you the headline in the picture Google News you go to Yahoo news any in your on Facebook what are you looking at you looking at the pictures in the first the first words that's that's that's the key that's that's the mindset that where you can do all your market research sitting on the can with your fast and if something really grabs you that's why you seeing the news even if it doesn't have anything to do with him they figure out of Way on those new services to put a picture of the president in everybody you there love and where you hate him but that's what US people that's not interesting so cool meeting as the one thing I would I would want to Mallard vs understanding that really understand what I said that's when you know it's working yes so that's that's a big one to take away from this number to one man's journey with sales cap the secret of all the effect of advertising is not the creation of new and tricky words and pictures but one of putting familiar words and pictures into new relationships that was quote by Leo Burnett I do not consider myself a professional copywriter because I do not write copy for other people I create professional level copy to sell my own stuff that's the difference nobody is born writing sales copy except maybe around 16 that's the due to do the pocket fisherman the showtime rotisserie in the inside the egg Scrambler his ability to create office right copy and products is unmatched you and I will not born knowing how to write sales copy the great news you can work in the early years I designed flyers for my college fraternity parties the pressure was on because of people don't show to the parties I would lose my job as social chairman along with all the privileges was first choice of room and also prestige with all the boys when I worked at for the mortgage banks I wrote the roads every week my branch manager asked me to ride an ad I had to have it to her by Wednesday so she could send it over the compliance department so it could run on the weekend you're the Antwerp pretty good but the bank really round the ads exactly the way I did them because the compliance department hey did I wanted to use words that work good to use in banquettes because they made the regulators nervous it was one of the reasons why I stopped working for the finely the how the compliance department called and said because we're not going to run because there were so many laws about what you could and could not say these people were gun shave anything that look like exciting cells that was a very inauspicious beginning to myself copywriting career I said Selling online 1997 with decent results at the time I start selling online I was bankrupt and living in a trailer Park after terrible business decisions you can't learn how to make great decisions until you make bad decisions well I wasn't selling the world on fire but it was making a little bit and then in the fall of 2000 a realise that something had to change to get out the trailer park where I've been for 6 years my ability to persuade people to buy from me had to improve to do that I had to run better at write more compelling copy for the web and gets seriously good at putting words on paper to encourage people to buy decision to do whatever it I was sitting in the tiny office in our spare bedroom from that moment I became a serious student of sales copy I read all the classic I can get my hands on like scientific advertising in my life and advertising you actually find my recommended reading list in the appendix of the i.saw.it writing and testing copy everywhere I could someone from my products but Elsa wrote some for a few real estate agents as a favour and put something up watch what happened in often nothing would happen when something good did have instead of talking it up too late I studied were kept doing that stop doing what didn't work and never quit examine the good Cop during the summer of 2000 I went to work for a company sales letter to sell a 97 hours CD-ROM there's a picture of an in the book 1 page 11 dad had a create the autorun CD and do the screen capture video which actually in 2000 studio the sales letter made 100000 hours for the company in 3-months which was a big deal to the company I figured out how to create a 6-figure sales weather for this guy in less than 90 days my wife and I moved out the trailer or low house and then he fired me in June of 2001 I will never forget that Friday and will a new home complete with payments no job in my fledgling ability to write sales copy I was scared I'll never forget my wife said when I arrived you basically have 30-days to make this work and by the way if you could just make a third of what you made for him will be fine the guy paid me $1,500 a month that was $18,000 a year that's where my selfwealth was at this point I was making 1500 bucks a month play computer in never give up on my dream of making all this internet stuff work I am living proof that learning how to write good sales copy can change your life no matter

copyright that's the end of secret number to any questions do know I just ordered and that's a very motivating chapter stuff that I didn't but I didn't talk about him then yeah I have known the sum of the filler story of from the years I've known you and but still that is very motivating and I hope it is motivating listening right now they say you know figure out the sales copy stuff and get one of these wizards I think what what happens is that people as soon people looking at guys like you and me and Russell and and others and so you know they just it was easy for them and what you don't understand is that we faced face and continue to face lots of obstacles and the thing to understand also is that when you persevere and you focus on The Wright Stuff you can get really good results fast but fast is a relative term to it's not going to happen overnight people assume that you can do something overnight I'm insane online for over 22 years now and I'm I'm close to being an overnight success right I'm hoping this will pay off you in another 2/3 years and I'll be an overnight success so the key that was your ability to sell offline is is huge for your ability to actually make the kind of money and have an impact that you want ok let's keep going secret number 3 without a strong why people don't buy I've got another amazing quote here for me from the real smart person people

memorize them then you can just come into page 16 in the book and uses many of these reasons why as you can in your copy to tie down the past don't fall into the trap of always making making a saving money because that's what the vast majority of lazy copywriters do it's all about making money or saving that's it get creative and how you use these reasons and make yourself stretched so that was speaking emagrece do any questions raise to the bar because everybody's trying to race to the bottom price but with you give people enough reasons why price and convenience become irrelevant because they want it so badly because they have so many reasons why on tag to the dental care that doesn't come for a week they don't care if the package is dented they don't care about anything other than oh my god I got to have this because this is why you know imagine there their spouse asking why did you buy that because it's going to help me to do this and help me I'll tell you a quick story and then we'll have this up I and I'll see this those of you who were seen this and this is where the first info products I ever made called real estate marketing online 2-hours to Martin power learn the secrets to making big commissions using email and that's what the bag looks like and it's actually a VHS tape I would duplicate these things in the back of my trailer I had a 5 VHS machines that I would do you put all the stuffing and then you can play on the one record Accord Accord Accord Accord my neighbours honestly thought that I was producing p*** because her with all his and boxes of VHS tapes and this is to my knowledge one of the first screen capture video products ever made any it was I got a thing called the scan converter that I can hook my computer to a to my to my hooked to the TV to record and I had to I had I had 600 hours to my name was living in the trailer and I had to go buy a mixdeck and a switch called the super VHS they made Super VHS was a higher-end VHS and it was $500 for the two thanks we had 600 hours in the bank we declared bankruptcy no credit cards anything and I had to tell him I had to explain to my wife justify this thing I might be able to start selling this week because I had a speaking engagement that the family week this is a Friday and stuff on salary Saturday and Sunday and did this thing and you know the funny thing is that had to do this is a 2-hour 2-hour BHS training I had to do it in real time I could not stop I could not because of the way it was done you couldn't edit on BHS it was it was all or nothing and so I said they're made this thing but I sold her on all the different reasons why we had to have the stuff and then I held my breath when I got done telling her and she looked at me and Easter weekend for in I remember think of myself now she really believes in me I'd better pull this off and I did and ended up selling $3,000 worth of these from the stage when I spoke and this was the very first screen capture video product ever made on this is the second one that I made all the stuff that I learnt doing this I was then able to apply this was the one I made for the guy that we saw the 100000 hours worked in in 3-months but I figured out had a burn this thing to CD-ROM had a duplicated powder packaging had to do everything all started with this and all started with me being in the cell my wife using all those reasons why and we had to do what we had to do so I know I want to share that story but it was it was a big deal it was it's all this progression and sometimes you gotta know it sometimes you can be able to sell your Styles before anyone else that's really good point I mean it's such a great journey though I mean you're getting into the meat potatoes of this book it is nice to hear yeah this is this is the long form Hero's Journey and you know it's we all start off nobody cares about you and yourself happy 2000x session having a bad day you don't care about anything except whether you're going to get what you're supposed to do when you want again I know the sounds harsh but it's true I'm sure there's a unicorn out there that sympathetic towards you and what's going on in your life and wants to know what's happening and how they can help you before they give you money but they're the vast minority an hour's in change the perspective change the verb example play Hero of your sales message you they want a picture themselves getting the results not you they want the whole transaction to be about them know about you and the way you do this is the converter copy from talking about yourself to talking about them how will they be in rich how will they benefit how will they receive what they search through your car look for I mean my wee hours than rephrase rewrite and repositioned to use the words you you're in yours instead sometimes you're just rephrase a couple of sentences or maybe only a half percent in other cases you might look at this and say you know what I'm talking about me here and I'm getting off on a little bit of an ego trip that has nothing to do with that I need a rewrite this to explain how this is going to benefit them I need to show them how my breakthrough will help them to get the results that they want it doesn't mean you know use the word I mean my wee hours but you can't just do it making sure that you're making all about them that's how you're make it work it sounds harsh but nobody cares about you they only care about themselves when you're buying from you kind of Elementary what was also found upon the never write about themselves in the first person back in the day but it's absolutely true they don't want to hear about you what they want to do with hear about you how you are going to help them and that huge what you come up with that one other than like writing 101 it just some over the years that I paid attention to and from study and experimentation and tracking results and I've also noticed when when I've had my headlines that blue and we're gonna talk about headlines and testing headlines and stuff but especially headlines when your headlines are about you usually they suck not when they're headlines are about your prospect their desires their problems what they want the payoffs for typically that's where you're going to do really really well so it is just a matter of experimentation think about it I

copywriter so somebody got a shoutout in their chapter mistrust yeah I tell you I'm glad you also mentioned the final script side because that is a arm between save time save money and save frustration doing it yourself that is the answer right there and you want me to remind you about making Facebook videos your start headlines in and the first words that come out of your mouth so for about a year I was doing a Regular Show on my on Facebook called let the chickens out with Jim and I would jump on 34 even 5 days a week and now answer question and it was its my shout and so they would start the show was hairy butt and I live in the same house all the time and have pretty much the same walk over to the chickens every so it's not uncommon for it to look like each day is not a new day because I wear either grey t-shirts or black t-shirts are were the same or navy blue t-shirts in the same every single day I do it at the same time every day in so honestly if I start every video the same if I look the same and I'm doing at the same time of day then people I've already seen that video or Ivo you know I've seen this or maybe I saw this right on that was getting a certain level of performance so then one day I said ok I need to follow my own advice instead of starting the videos with Picasa additional let me check it out with jam today we're going to talk about what I did was the first words out of my mouth were what we were going to talk about so instead of starting with the hairy by humanitarian welcome to not listen I've left the check it out with Jim you can tell me I've got that down to that as well as doing every single time now I would start with I have written down so like I said the first words out of my mouth what should you do if somebody argues with you on Facebook hey guys welcome to another edition of let the chickens out with Jim so now I leave the very first word and my mouth are the hook the headline the thing that let's them know what this is about in when I started doing that my number of views in my number of comments on my number of reactions because people were thinking that they had seen this one before cos I was talking about something different so that right there that doesn't tell you how important that is I don't know what else I could tell you would be because it's it's that's what determines whether people are going to watch the rest of the video just like with an article where they're going to read the video I mean it really if you if I did that with an article I would deserve to get punched in the face because that would be like having the same headline for every article on my block even though we had different kinds the headline was here what number does not let the chickens out with Jim I get 50 articles with the title hey here's another another edition of what the chickens out of gym so the first word that your mouth or not about you they're not about anything other than what's in it for them right now with whatever you're going to share and simple but it was profound as far as the impacts what if I'm wearing a different mask that you've never seen before if I'm wearing a hat then that helps differentiate the the video because it people if you just look at the video and you saw agent during the week I think I saw that and then you're just on to the next so that's another it's kind of a behind-the-scenes but again I hope your head might be a question it can be an image well I hope can be like today you guys if you just listen you not see this but I got this hat that makes me look like I'm a garden now not a dunce cap but it makes me look like I'm a gardener see yes I would say garden now so that's that's something that I think it is worth noting as well variate and I'm guilty of that cos it's just easier to turn on your camera and enjoy it in usual spot or go and collect your chickens out of Uruguay llamas or your peacock's whatever so keep that in mind I think it's important even else no good call I like them alright cool so next secret secret number 6 the number one single most important piece of sales car music on the average 5 times as many people read the headline as read the body car and that's advertising Legend David Ogilvy the number one copywriting skills everybody needs is to write great headlines statistics that out of 10 people who see an advertisement or a webpage read the headline but only 2 out of 10 read the rest of the copy I don't know if that's accurate and I can tell you from personal experience that a great headlining mediocre copy will outperform excellent copy with a week headline and the reason is really simple reason is that great headlines get you up that more often if your headlines sax nobody read your sales letter nobody read your and nobody watch your video but if you have a great headline that grabbed someone's attention people read yourself with a reader and watch your video the purpose of a headline is so listen carefully to me people the purpose of a headline is simple it's to get people to stop what they're doing in start reading or watching whatever it is you put in front of the weather is a physical sales letter a sales letter on the web video sales letter and add a Facebook post whatever it is the headline will determine your success without exception Barrowman you have to write great headline that's the number one skill everybody needs to develop no matter what you sell who you sell it the secret of a great headliners one that connect emotionally with the person who represents your perfect past a well-written headlines people emotionally usually around either fear or a Desire or both your headline targets either something they're scared of or something they really want and it does so on an emotional level a great headline targets radio audience you don't want people who aren't in your target audience reading past the headline and when you think about online advertising where you have to pay money for people to read your ad or click your ad a great headline can actually cut down on the number of clicks you get what massively increase the quality of the cliffs you the reason headlines are so important is because the whole sales process cannot start unless the headlines stop them in their tracks and give them to pay attention to what you're saying here are the consequences of not really good headlines one you get terrible results to you get frustrated and probably give you waste a lot of time energy and effort Dell Campion sells messages that nobody actually read number for you're always at a disadvantage because enough for the right people will never see yourselves message let me tell you a quick story that illustrates the secret about headlines and action hopefully it brings this lesson home to I've been selling online for about 9-years at the time I don't remember the exact date but I created a product called five steps to getting anything you want in fact here's a copy of it right here how's that for a proxy do and those of you that are watching on the video you can see I'm holding it it's in Audio CD when we fill you in on a little backstory I was bankrupt in a trailer park for 7 years but I turn my act around in large part to my ability to write sales copy and sell educational products as well overcoming some self-esteem issues I was dealing I took all the things I learnt in turned into this course I was extremely proud of I poured terms of time every I'm working a recorded it as an audio CD which at the time was very difficult to do in we spend all this money to produce the product I was totally wrapped up in this product emotionally and financially when we started trying to arrange for the product sent email campaign it was excited because I had this great message to share with people I started seeing the traffic coming to my website but no sales built hundreds and thousands of people visit the website but nobody by meals to say I freaked out I thought am I going to do and then I took a deep breath and I ask myself a question what would a good copywriter do in this was a voice inside me respond immediately it said they would test a headline didn't say it just like that voice but I just figured out simulator small voice for you but her voice the latest headlines in within a few minutes I had a sale ring headlight now the final headline that I changed it to wise how to gain a positively unfair advantage in business and in life window sale started coming in after changing only the headline the importance of the headline came home to me in a very real way the first headline focused on me and anaesthetic the whole bankrupt trailer Trash idea was a turn off people just couldn't connect with that but with the emotional benefit of how to gain an unfair advantage in business and in life people yeah I want an unfair advantage it's almost like a guilty pleasure type of thing in our payoff where they can fill in the blanks for one in unfair management for them individually just by changing the headline I said the entire project and skyrocketed my business by the way we are six

develop your swipe file in your start getting ideas especially for everything from articles and blog posts to email teases by paying attention to which headlines catch your eye that's a shortcut by the develop your swipe out and pay attention of formulas that help you create headlines fast the most significant piece of advice I have for you when it comes to headlines besides acknowledge in the fact that you need to use them which is least spend time on your headline in not treated as an afterthought so many people the number one headline mistake people make that bleeds and the Curiosity once you have a headline that works test new headlines against that one to see if you can improve results I have seen as much as a 500% improvement and sales just by changing a single headlight in practice to yeah you know what but it was you needed to because it is the I think it's number one most thing as far as someone who has a store like myself with 3240 different items that I sell in depending on what that person is looking for a headline has to grab and then I usually like the same you have something in the cells copy that will grab them even more so they collect them so I think Musa said that 1-hour Park great chapter remember we discussed this a long time ago and one of our training programs that with with the Jim Edwards method and that was a a big changer for me because I went through using your wizards and just changed about 20 different headlines of articles and topics and son overnight difference absolutely and it really is true that Dad's won't get you up to and I know you're a big baseball fan in for those that know what baseball is we don't know the more time to get up to about the better your chances of your average might suck but you can make up for it with quality so that's why you need to get up that first so you can see what's working so you can improve your form and improve the rest of your carp if you never give up back as your headlines sucks doesn't matter with you get a smooth when you're not because you never going to see a ball alright shall we do another he was a master copywriter four years from years past when he wrote the statement the internet did not exist if your password is aware of your product and has realised that it can satisfy this Desire your headline starts with the product if he is not aware of your product but only has the desire itself your headline starts with the design if he is not yet aware of what he really 6 but is concerned with the general problem your hairline starts with the problem and crystallizes it into a specific needs in our online world their heart warm in traffic sources not going to dictate and someone who doesn't even realise there's a solution out there but knows they have a problem is a cold sores in each group needs to receive a different message from you therefore it's not one-size-fits-all so I'll give you an example using the physical training PT testing example from a good friend of mine Stu Smith this book about used to wait what's up here every samples about you what was I like Stan boy that that week I do appreciate the plugs so steals a former Navy SEAL undergraduate the US naval academy who trains all the specialists guys coming out the neighbour Academy he also prepares people for the military police and firefighter profession information about PT testing in preparation for physical training test to either enter or stay in some physically demanding occupations here are the different messages he sends depending on the so do I hard traffic people who knows still granny's newsletter last see specific copy every time he releases a new book about how to get ready for a PT test it straightforward all the ads all the copy of the social media posts hey Steve Smith there just came out of the new book call Peter stanislaus 2-weeks need to check it out because it's going to show you how to do this this this is the direct message works well for those people who know speak now for Warren traffic sources do targets people on Facebook you don't know him but are in the military or some other profession where they have to get ready for ptt you write sad about about preparing for the pg test getting in shape in case you what to do if you're failing in Harrow improving specific areas all these ads and post direct people to his book but he needs to get their attention first with a solution there already looking for then he leads them to the books I know then get ready for a PT test they know the desired result passed the test so the receptor to add in concert about those tablets now when it comes to a quote traffic sort this group of people is in terrible they consistently failed RPG test and they don't know what to do to fix the problem therefore they get messages around topics Belfast bt10 don't know what to do you're not here is the solution with the targeted approach each group gets different language in their sales message however most people sales copy would read me help people pass their ptt what's wrong with the sales copy people who are ready no you don't need that information they need specifics about how you can help them right now people who don't know you better looking for a solution may respond to that General message will respond better to specific messages like we help people pass the FBI Academy PT test or we help people passed the rest GT test or we help people get ready for a seal can't find me for people who don't even know there's a possibility they could pass their PT test or they're focused on a specific pram like being overweight struggling with slow run times or recovering from overuse injuries that General message won't resonate with them when running sells cab you need to be conscious of these three groups depending on where you are in your business you may have a lot of people in one group vs and if you're just getting started the majority of the people will be in the warm in the cold groups if you have a business product or service that requires a lot of explanation of people don't know the solution even exist the most of your traffic is going to be cold if your traffic is called your message needs to focus on people's problems then you transition from talking about the problem to the need by your solution to that getting the correct sales message to the right people can make a huge difference in whether that you lose money break-even or your profitable by the way the easiest place to segment your traffic using this approach is on Facebook unfortunately now with tools like clickfunnels it's a lot easier to set up several different learning pages to steer each type of traffic to so that you can put the right messaging for the right people in your message makes all the difference when someone is looking at your headline in your head that person quickly decides is this for me there's this guy understands my problem so what are the consequences of not applying this particular secret focus on you and your product but what if you know do that what have you ignore them and tell them only way you want to say that the person says to you I think I get a virus on my computer and I don't know what to do about it you respond with information about uncle James any IRIS software how got a 5-star review from the National board of review and they look at you and say how do I get this virus off my computer you say uncle James any virus sufferers right number one in the conversation doesn't make any sense you're talking about your product and yourself and they're talking about their problems know you might seem yourself actually gym surely they can make that mentally hey it's the number one anyway IRIS software in the world are we still take that virus off your computer but will it is it the right software for their computer and the virus that's affecting them right now I don't know the answer and you're not giving it to them your software is not there Focus your brand is not there Focus your name is not there Focus you've got to get in sync with the conversation they want to have first so you can steer them towards the solution yourself so they're Pakistan problems you start the conversation with the problem to get in sync with them then you show them you got the solution so if your new friend with the infection is looking for a specific resource Solutions such as hey I need anti-virus software but they're not saying I need uncle Jim's any virus or four than you need the new lead with you need any virus software get this app but it that same person says hey I'm thinking about uncle James any virus software then they need to see a message about uncle James any virus software specifically general and about anti-virus software if they say I have a problem with my computer running slowly and it shuts off without warning sometimes you don't say you have a virus you say oh your computers shutting down unexpectedly there are three typical reasons for let me tell you what they are then you lead them to potential fixes including antivirus software that last point is a fine line and you may need a reader we listen to that but the Fine Line is the difference between selling 1% of the people who showed your website and selling 20% of people who show up to your website here's a short the fastest way to figure this out as to think through the conversations you can have with heart warm and cold people about your product or service what would be the conversation with someone who knows who we are and what we do what would be the what will the conversation be like with someone who has a where they have a problem but they're not aware of us or our product yet and the third conversation with the third question would be what would the conversation be like with people who know they have a problem have absolutely no clue a solution even exist to put this in Action on a website quickly you going to make three different copies of the webpage to create 3 different learning pages then you're going to change the headline of each page to match the traffic temperature based on the traffic source heart warmer call then you look at the sales copy from your audience standpoint and adjust the existing text to fit a lot of times you can get 99 yards down the field with a few simple Tweeks especially at the very beginning of yourselves message which is often called the lead for the sake of expediency don't try to target each group at the same time take the one you think you can get the most mileage from the fastest and concentrating on them first for example if you have an email list Focus all your marketing on this heart traffic source first do the same thing with your followers on Facebook and other social after that target the warm market and then finally write copy for the cold more and by the way the cold market is usually the largest if you can connect with them that's how you break into the world of big sales summary the different audiences who can use your product or service II identified as audiences and commit to put the right messages in France them and finally don't be lazy inform the trap of one-size-fits-all with yourselves messages I want to share one last thing with you guys it's not in the book so it's you know how do you my words Funnel scripts is going to revolutionize yourself copy and give you the power of a professional copywriter at the click of a mouse that works great if you know who Jim our doesn't you know what Funnel scripts is Academy I know it happened so the people you get in his habit you get in this group where you know exactly what to tell your audience to get them to take action and then you want to scale it up but you don't matter by the copy to read some money has no clue who you are and doesn't know about your product and may not even know there's a solution out there so it's really really important that you understand that especially if you had success in any questions or darts to know it's very important that you differentiate obviously have one and cold because it is it is succeed failure difference so where where did you come up with that I've had read that in Eugene schwartz his book long time ago and it's weather swear you read it and you saw them understand and then truth be told I read the quote again in Russells.com secrets book and he applied it towards traffic and that's when the the light bulb went off as far as that quote in the neck cause me to really look back and think ok when when have things work amazing and when have things work like crap and typically when they work amazing it's when you're totally in sync with the type of traffic that you're getting and then when it works like crap which is usually trying to run ads call Dad's to copy is where you just blow up and get destroyed in and I've learnt that very expensive lesson several several times in my life that's where it came yeah well too good lesson penicillin glad you shared it because I've made the same mistake myself you know the same I have sent to my newsletter you know that I am send your Facebook ad

other stuff but I digress you need to know what's on freds mind and what's going on inside his head because what's going on inside his head will determine whether you sell something not where do you get an afternoon and what you get a cliff or not you need to know what's going on in Friends mind better than he does you need a now had end of the conversation going on inside his head and if you are talking about what he wants to talk about if you don't show him what he wants to see and if you don't tell him what he wants to hear you everything you have done the how to define your target audience before we go any further you need to know some stuff I have a starling admission still there I got thrown out of business so I got a D minor in statistics the only reason I passed the test sticks and managerial accounting was because I agree to drop out of the business school and go major in history everything I'm teaching you cancel my direct experience it is not Siri this is not wearing a classroom because obviously I was incapable of learning this in a classroom I had the learning when my money in my livelihood was on the line this information is all based on hands-on in the trenches selling people stuffed belly to belly or through the first figure out who they are there two schools of thought when it comes to defining your target audience I prefer the term niche my friends in Canada pronounce instead of target audience I prefer the term niche instead of target audience because it refers to a specific group or subgroup of people many times when you hear people talk about niches they're talking about keyword counts or keyword numbers mine it has 100000 searches for this or mileage has a million whatever you something you need to understand them very close attention you were about to say people will buy from a keyword count does not buy from you more specifically people will buy from you one person at a time you have to know who these people are in what they have in common that makes them belong to the group you like agenda look at location demographics numbers based the problem is that demographics Arbroath so I can tell you that the typical people who buy from me are between the ages of 40 and sixty-five 60% of women and 40% of men and they live in the United States United States Australia Great Britain Canada and then it's all around the rest of the world that's still too broad to be able to Sony it's a thing that people would be in on demographics but if you try and use demographics you're going to have a tuft I'm selling anything to anyone I prefer to use psychographics psychographics refers to what's going on inside of a person's head what are they thinking what's motivating that what are the added to the aspirations are you psychographic first and then I refine my niche with Demi psychographics of things I understand Fred has specific problems Fred also has interest desires and goals these are the things that matter in sales copy if I know your problems if I understand you're interested if I know your desires I know your goals then I know how to communicate with you I know how to put little presents out instead of you that get your attention I know how to get in touch with your feeling I knew had understand identify various situations you gonna find yourself in where I could put myself message in front of you can use this information in Arabic and your message because understanding audiences more about excluding people than it is including people I would rather have an audience of 10000 laser focus people who I can give a specific sales message to as opposed to 100000 people who are casually interested in something that on the ways to turning money putting sells copying from that will never buy anything target audience is and you need a specific way to do that that's exactly when I help you right now they're really three levels of definition of the first is the idea of a niche niche is very broad an example is realistic real status to general to be able to run ads and right meaning for sales copy secondly we need to move into what I call a sudden itch this is a narrow part of the bigger neck in our example of sending it would be a real estate investor within the sadness there different types of real estate investors I personally have been in several different niches I've been a flipper I've been buying hold I've been a hard money lender we need a drill down even more defined our friend now we look at a micro niche where we get laser focused again the sudden it was a small part of the broadness and a micro nature's in there were part of the submerge in this case we might talk about slippers this is someone who buys a house men's around in 30 to 60 days hopefully had a proper now this microphone it's person is free literally this is Fred the red the slipper has very different needs than Ronnie real estate agent or Randy real estate investor or Sue and Johnny Homebase girls can be used as the magic words to convert them these are the words they're using right now so they know you hear them understand and you're not talking down the right message is the message that contains the words they're using they wanna hear in Pakistan De Niro is better despite what some will tell you it is time to put a message that's going to be affected with a million people that's more than institutional large-scale general type of offer if you're making a general type offering can find a group of a million that makes sense and do well with your ass then do most of us do much better if we can go if you pick wild and Niall deep rather than going through what deep and a mile wide and how we going to define arabica good after diving into this and using it for years I figured out a better way actually to explain or the code of what an avatar is you need to give your Avatar name because when you sit down to at the right copy from scratch I use a tool like Funnel scripts you need to have a specific person in mine remember I said you might sell to a million people but they each buy one at a time so you need to communicate to a specific person instead of to a group in this example we might use above in this example uses the bar or house slippers name is Fred the floor if your niche is gardeners' are they green times have a friend who sells workouts that he refers to as aberturas cat potatoes because they refer to themselves as couch potatoes he helps them become reformed couchpotato are they manners are they sci-fi Fanatic what are the who are they what is there when you need to give me you can change it later but you need to refer specific person another day you can do and I've done this is search Google for the see what pictures come up on Google Images then pick one and printed out when you're preparing yourself can you visualise talking to a writing to that specific person makes a huge difference in your ability to create quality now that we know who to sell people what they want Nat would they need to know some people get heartburn everyday and I'm not saying you don't include white people need in whatever you sell but from the standpoint of your copy you only talk about what they want do not tell them what they need because just like telling a child I need to go to bed I'll say screw you I want to stay at short pixie sticks and once the all-night Bonnie to marathon on the Netflix that's what they want don't talk about what people need talked about what people want include what they need in whenever you sell them or whatever service you offer them but when you write carby you only talk speak show and include what they want it is crucial you understand this distinction when I thought this people say well that's not ethical gym you need to sell them what they need or they won't get the results you promised what I'm saying you were sell them what they want you can what they need now here's bread at the next pqr to is the secret code to your audiences bro what the heck does pqr to stand for it stands for problem question ROBLOX and results that picture this on page 66 of bread is it the top of a chasm on oneplus looking at another Cliff across the your people are here as he wants to be on the other side to get results how is he going to bridge that gap your sales copy will Bridge the gap what's on the side were Friday standing he's aware this problem he's got questions there ROBLOX there definitely is holding him back he is completely turned into his problem is questions in his ROBLOX he's also tuned into the results you want are there on the other Cliff he wants to go from the left to the right side from here to there what's going to help in do that and this is a critical distinction guys what's going to help him do that is yourself it's not your problem it's not your service it's not your software he can't physically make the leap until he makes it in his mind first your sales can help him do that his problems his questions and his ROBLOX have him firmly planted on the first clue what he wants our results which are on the other side the problems questions ROBLOX and results are what define your niche you take these problems questions ROBLOX and results and you turn them into a sudden attack or a micro niche no let's look at it from another perspective we know where Fred it's Friday prams questions on ROBLOX he wants results but the vast majority of people are caught up in their problems it's like he's stuck on that first class we have the stick on the we have the carrot in pronunciation of this you go to page 68 in the power of the Stick is much more prevalent in his world than the carrot in fact if you look at it it's a ratio of 3:1 Francis prams questions in Roblox on one side and his desired results over on the other side to move him across the chasm you build a bridge with yourself happy if he has questions you showing you have answered that he's got ROBLOX you Sean how to remove them because always thinking about all these problems questions and Roblox for him to move forward he's got to see that you can solve problems providing answers and remove ROBLOX only then will he believes he can get those results only then is he willing to me journey across the Bridge from where is now to where is going to be in by any former sales copy can be used to help Fred move across the chasm it can be a video sales letter can be long form cells that are concert video on article any copy what do you think about it says copy or you think of this concept market

boredom the fun by the way what are the most overlooked component of any sales copy is focusing on see how you can add fun that's where the keys that we used to sell the Jimbo accrue seminar we've

when we created Funnel scripts when you know Fred and have Funnel scripts you can create any piece of cells cafe you need Funnel scripts takes your Fred parts and helps you assemble them into a fantastic happy with the click of your mouth knowing Fred give you all the building works you need to create amazing sales copy without spending years trying to master that's why you need to identify Fred figure out friends pqr to and you have the keys to the kingdom when it comes to creating copy understanding what is the career success summary know your onions better than they know themselves pay as much or more attention the psychographics as you do Democrat democratic no friends pqr and if you want a shortcut ahac use Funnel scripts that can't help automatically put all of this research and knowledge about Fred in yourself copy faster than by any other method play that's mine I came up with that going to be exposed by somebody on a YouTube video as stealing other people's quotes at least for that so yeah that's me and that like I said I mean that Fred actually the name on came from something else which was fears and it was it was results and Saturn and desires that was Fred came from originally but now the pqr to just just really hits it better was looking back through the books only remember what friends staying over fear result expectations and desires on that was good but not as useful as pqr to but pqr to doesn't sound like a name so I kept Fred and gave him a new way to be define no I think it's great like I said you know you take something that's a very vague concert when you tell somebody you know what is you're well you need to research what does that mean and I think this chapter is going to be a great reference to of people to go back to and say what was that list I need to do again I think that's going to be very useful well this gives you the building blocks and you know we like to use building wax and those big LEGOs and stuff but there's different ways to research staff and different ways to research the market but when you're talking about researching the market for creating sales copy in really content creation as well as you know again different resales copying content as we talked about that already but this is the type of research that's going to give you the building works to be able to create the sales carp in the messages that are going to motivate people to buy try clicking sign up and that's really what this is all about need to go back onto the scripts in the did a couple head lighting strips La Liga I was listening and doing it's come up and do you want to share a job I didn't write them down into my computer though and so I don't have them immediately this year but they're easy I said I just 5 question 6 questions boom boom boom about 50 different options read through but you'll have a woman before I saw something I really like that like let's change it so I've already made changes into the store so we will see you guys in the next section big as you mate along with my body Smith hello welcome back we're on day two were going to get started here with secret number 9 but there's one thing and talk about it more once we get into the book was thinking about this yesterday since yesterday I was thinking about this when I was running this morning how important it is to understand that once you learn the formulas in the blueprints and I'm trying to teach your mindset and other stuff in the book but once you learn these formulas in his blueprints you really have to go use them it's it's fine turn know about them but it's it's kinda like working out you can know about pull-ups and push-ups and proper running form and stuff like that until you actually go get sweaty and do it you don't realise ok put your hands here position your body there this week I need to do this differently I need to do more of this kind of stuff and so they're lot of people who will tell you about tails carpet and once you start writing it everybody in your brother has an opinion about sales copy all that's too long that's too short it doesn't hamyna promotion I would never say that the only opinion that matters about yourself happy is the opinion of the person with the credit card in their hand to eye there is or is not typing as digits into the the computer to send you money through the interwebs so I just I wanted to share that with you maybe I was getting grumpy yesterday was making me run down the road this morning I'm excuse me student make me run down the road I motivate on my own because about the health benefits of a proper workout 6 days a week that's true but you know as well as sales copy in fitness like I write a workout program it might be the great work greatest workout program that you run out reap the benefits of such program unless you go do it will learning all the sales copy it was you will not read the benefits of learning ourselves start putting it into a right end in when you're first using it I want you to understand you need to be careful of the good opinion of other people because I've had people to all you're doing your pull-ups wrong so you're doing your push-ups wrong I wouldn't run like that so I wouldn't stretched like that so you're doing your crunches wrong and this is affected telling you this so my point is that you need to just go do it and see what happens and adjust from there and be really careful when people start giving people start giving you advice don't take workout advice from a fat man don't take health advice from a doctor that smoke I am selling it ok what's before this gets to other hand let's let's get back to the book secret number 9 the ultimate bullet formula Caribbean if anyone tells you you write copy copy is not written copy is a symbol you do not write copy you assemble it you're working with the series of building blocks you are putting the building blocks together and then you are putting them in certain structures you are building a little city of desire for your person to come and live it not a quote from Eugene schwartz on master of advertising pressure inside people to get them to buy faster bullets grab people's attention so you can address their specific wants and needs to make more sales bullets convey important information quickly so you can get your message across fast to maximize every advertising gala use the interesting thing is that one most people Creed bullets they only includes features for example if it's a drill Belsay it's 18 volts in I'll take up two and a 1 inch or 1 inch like that means something to somebody features are what we would put on technical specifications the problem is people don't buy because of features features are how they compare things people buy the benefits when you repeat that people by the benefits what are they going to get as a result of that picture what something is a benefit is what something does for you will take the drill exam it's 18 volts which is the future but what is that feature that featured does is enable you to drill through hard would like butter so you can draw the bunch of holes without recharging the battery every 5-minutes the fact that it will take up to a 1-inch bit the feature means you can do all types of projects especially around your home without having to switch to that's the benefits again understand the difference between features and benefits features don't make somebody buy something the benefit of those features get them to buy from you you don't need 1000 bullets in your copy depending on the copy job you doing I would take 456 a dozen excellent bullets over crappy bullets different functions in sales copy you can put two or three at the top of the sales letter right under the headline to suck you can use boats in the description of a product whether you're selling it on Amazon your website or in an email butterwort carry most of the weight of your car once your headline pulls the main you can use bullets to summarise what people will see in a video of people preview of your blog post list the benefits give people reasons to keep reading and make a decision sunrise what they're buying and much much more about what's in the book it feels changeable because I'm telling them things like this how to get up running and selling on Amazon Kindle fast the webs number 1 eBook retailer wants to sell your ebook for page 14 the surefire secret to create an eBook that sells like crazy while having more fun than you ever thought possible page 23 had a quickly avoid the number one mistake Arthur's maybe causes them to take months or years to write a book so you can finish and just a few days it's a step-by-step explanation of had actually get a complete real done in less than 72 hours page 103 the absolute bulletproof best ebook to write and sell Online class page to now I've also done this with video products to you can write bullets that provide the timestamp on specific video to get the Promise so bothered give people a reason to act carry the load of explaining what your product is and what it will do for I think the all-time truism about features and benefits is only partially correct you probably heard the Old say let's talk about wrenches hear some bullets I wrote for a set of DeWalt wrenches I've been lying on Amazon for 29 bucks but can't seem to pull the trigger on purchasing I guess I'm just not emotionally attached to them here's the original bullet list from Amazon 1 piece sae sizes chrome vanadium I'm going to have to say that vanadium Steel construction stamp markings for easirent size identification you're not very compelling I want to want these wretches so let's give him some help shall we one piece said so you can keep all your wrenches together in one place sizes so you have the exact size you need when you need it chrome vanadium vanadium Steel construction for strength and durability so you can work them hard stamp markings for easirent size identification so you can quickly find the right size already we've made a difference that's better than 80% of people do with their bullets just by adding the benefit but we want to do better than 99% of people out there and that's where my ultimate bullet formula comes are you ready are you ready is nanny said yes Peter + benefits + mean features what is benefit equals what it does in meaning equals what it means to the buyer reader or prospect so the formula is it blank so you can bring which means black light those wrench bullets on fire in make even the most inept dad with 6 stands on one hand believe that you can probably be the Mechanic hero he always dreamed a real honeydew pro are you ready one piece sets so you can keep all your rentals together in one place which means you'll never be left hand drive with the wrong wrench sae sizes so you have the exact size you need when you need it which means you can get projects done faster and move on with your life crown vanadium Steel construction for strength and durability so you can work them hard which means you'll spend a lot less money on tools overtime stamp markings for easirent size identification so you can quickly find the right size which means no more pulling your hair out over stripped nuts when you start talking about benefits and meaning yourself happy bolts on yourself happy and general will take a Quantum Leap in effectiveness and when you start thinking in terms of benefits and meaning The Sky's the Limit as far as you're selling powers concerned so as we wrap up the secret will writing both get the momentum going it's kinda like headline brainstorming as you make bullets you have ideas pop in your head for other bullet as you focus on the different features benefits and meanings of whatever it is you're selling your bullets will get better and better it's kind of like warming up for a run where the third of 4/5 that is where you get into a group your first bullet isn't nearly as good as your 6th or also if you need 506 boards write 10 and 12 and choose the best fibre six again it's just a game of my mentor in one last thing you can build a very effective swipe farm for bullets I would highly recommend you start creating a clip fire lovebullets you see that kept her attention just like having a swipe valve headlines having a swipe file bullets can come in handy when you need to brainstorm a bunch of them quickly to the workhorse you used to create curiosity in your copy five amazing bullets will outperform 30 good bullets always include mean when your bullets because that's the secret sauce that makes them better than everyone else is bullets gaining quote and maybe explain that one a little bit about a sibling sales coffee not writing sales copy so really still can be comes down to a bunch of building blocks and you can think about building blocks like a sales letter is a combination of a headline is the first black then opening black then maybe a video sales letter about the bullets as a block and then the welcome in the intro and the story in the bullets in the car and we'll get into the whole formula leader in a different chapter but that's one way to think about is far as building blocks another way to look at first building blocks is assembling like Desire meaning benefit feature all these things and if you think about the building blocks of a bullet a future benefit me in so anytime you talk about a feature the next thing you should talk about is what that benefit the benefit that feature is but you never quit until you tell me and there's another little thing that you can do to when you're playing around with person that you not have to use than every single time but you can also sprinkle improve with that as well so you know as an example of writing and I'm opening up here but if you think about those building blocks like LEGO so we did the example of a feature give me a feature of one of your on like a feature of your coaching program the your monthly what's a feature that your new work out every single every single yes ok so the features you get a new personalized workout every single in the meaning of that is the you don't have to think you'll just have to do her she's me the better feel that you don't have to take the meaning of that is that it's personalised so that you are maximum your time there's no wasted effort and so I waited to express that would be get personalized workout for a new personalized workout from Stu every single week so you can always be moving forward or whatever I said he cannot turn the details off tap my head and I probably should have been that was this was your you breaking down sells Carpet Right and building it back up and you broke it down into your 33 things of socks copy bright future benefit meaning and what I do is like summer comes to me as I really need to learn this combat swimmer stroke so I take the combat swimmer stroke and I say it's a pole to breathe at the cake it so glad so they see of movements to get you to do think so it's very similar way of breaking it down did you break down cells copy into those three or is it was something you learnt along the way when when you were learning sells coffee featuring benefit is something that everybody if you read anybody's anything you hear about that but then you hear people talking about emotional meaning if you can put emotion behind it in from my own experimentation I found that if you can put some sort of emotionally compelling meaning in there and oftentimes the benefit in the meaning can can be interchangeable they may even sound similar or the meaning might sound like a benefit in really you just trying to give a one-two punch so not everything has an emotional payoff but you should strive to hit it but then the proof playing some sort of of Proof or or some justification or something that says I'm at whistling Dixie so those those bullets for the book the proof element in there isn't in a son so got this result it's hey who's the feature in Harrogate up and running and selling an Amazon Kindle fast I that's the features how to get up and running the benefit as you can get salon Kindle fast and then the meaning is the web's number when you agree Taylor works to sell your book for you here's how and then the proof is it's on page four do you see what I mean that is a proof helmet so but I don't want to leave without finishing the example was trying to do with you because now I'm now I'm going to pierced if I start figured out you know you get a brand new work out every week so you can get you can and also never get bored by doing the same workout every single week if you're looking for I know you got it trying to the list I thought you're talking to me no no no but some sort of a proof element and we'll talk more about proof elements later bye something that makes it changeable so it's not just this feeling curiosity thing was like oh that's real then anyway that's that's how you do it once you get you want to get momentum going with bullets you want to just sit down and do three bullets and Teo and done you want to do 12:15 20 bullets and take the 325 best one because it really is a game of momentum what will also happens when your brain storming bullet you start thinking of headlines when your brain storming headline just start thinking of bullets they're very very closely intertwined so that's why brainstorming them in using swipe valves and stop many a times one of my bullets became a headline and a bunch of my headlines became bullet so that's something else to keep in mind as well so hopefully that is a good little extra not a confusing will extra but definitely thinking in terms of feature benefit in me cool so let's keep going secret number 10 what really sells people and it's not what you think not actually got two quotes for you today there are two modes to act self-interest and fear that from Napoleon Bonaparte a short dude who almost took over the world and when dealing with people remember you are not dealing with creatures of logic but creatures are vmotion not a quote from Dale Carnegie the secret is about the why and how to get people to react with emotion because emotion is what drives sales it takes the previous secret about bullets to the next level how well talk about features and benefits features are what something is it got an 18 volt drive motor have interim bit capacity is a 30-minute real-time exercise DVD the benefit is what the feature does for somebody meaning is what does features and benefits combined mean to someone they know the benefit of the 18-volt drive motor is that it gives you more power and you never run out you never had a last to do your project but that last step is the most critical you need to tell people about the outcome meaning create emotion the 18-volt drive motor has all the power to handle any project but what does that mean to my ideal prospect in fact you need to answer that question about any claims or feature or benefit you present the people in yourselves copy it could mean your wife is happy you'll get the honey-do list done quickly it means you're burnt to every job with enough time to left to sit on the couch and watch the football game it means you'll see the smile on your kids base project you doing together it means you have some more free time this weekend instead of waiting for the battery to recharge meaning is the next level of connecting with people on a level about what your product service software etc will do for them which is where people buy because you may have heard people buy on emotion and they justify on internet and that's how do you find the mean easy everytime you see a clear picture or benefit ask yourself some questions why is that important why does that matter why is that a big deal now you might ask why would I want to make a drill emotional and my responses if you sell drills and want to sell Arbonne get people emotional about drills make them feel cool by only natural make him feel smart by having that drill make them feel like they're a member of the top guy club more popular bionet drill kid by hammering that drill and your sell more drill now by the way this idea injecting emotion through meaning of anything you sell which is why it's important in motion as what sells you have to drill down pun intended to that emotion find it and expand you might be saying that strategy is it when I see the drill has a magnetic playing on the front so you can keep screws secure while doing your job that means there's no chance of those sharp screws dropping in hitting somebody on the head while you 10 feet up on a ladder that one feature could keep someone from getting a screw in bedded in their head maybe even your kids again you might think that's a little bit of a stretch but it's not you've got to drill down to that emotion tidy each one of those features the cooldown it's just like taking us bullets or any other claiming doing that first part of the formula it blank so you can blank now your dementia lies in the product now going to the park that's going to get people say yeah that's what I wanna feel that's all I care about that it's blue or that it's got this logo on it but I want my kids to be safe on my wife to be happy I want to be able to relax only be able to get to stand honey do list done so I can sit and watch the game and bar sleep and still not resolved the problem I sure that's what the straw means in as soon as you can make a connection your sales are going to get the consequences of not doing this or severe if you cared connect on an emotional level then you're the same as everybody else when people evaluate your product coaching software whenever you sell based on price alone because that's all they have to go you haven't made them feel anything but as soon as you make them feel something that when you have than need a powerful why if you want them to buy because why create emotion I'll tell you a quick so here's the reason I signed up to the it's confession time with Stu and don't be getting a swollen head or sending me all kind of messed up workouts over the next week still ok is not adding so here's the reason I signed up to do physical coaching with a guy named Sue Smith he sends me work after email even though I've been working out already and I'm plenty of with exercises in them questions about work out the reason I initially signed up with him was the emotional motivation of hey my trainers are Navy SEAL that's pretty badass initially I enjoyed the emotional ego here of telling people hate my personal trainers and baby seal and I let that slip every once in a while maybe more than I should because it's pretty cool now in my 50s I'm in better shape the most 25-year olds I can do 33 pull-ups 100 push-ups 100 sit-ups in a row without stopping and because of Dad emotional connection to my train being abecele I'm a nice guy and let him down by slacking on workouts and be knocking look like Mr Potato Head Over Again especially if I want to tell people my trainers and ABC that emotional reason for signing up buying click has all types of consequences for yourself on as far as your prospective concerned you've got to find an emotional connection and amplifier the more emotions you can tidy your product or service to like love fear of blank in hope the better of you are Lisa that again the more emotions you can't I your product or service to like love fear of black hair and hope the better off you are putting this interaction is super easy wait for those beer I can hear going how am I going to do this jam here's the trick as soon as you make a statement about something listing feelings that people tie your product the heat tired to fear of whatever fear of failure fear making mistakes fear of death fear of loss tied to vanity why do people buy Mercedes why would someone buy a Rolls-Royce Bennet pride and warning for black so tired to some sort of warning warning for fulfillment morning 4-piece longing for completion tie your product to greet I approached the free tie your product or service to the things people want their core and you'll be able to connect emotionally much more quickly now that you're conscious of this you need to use this knowledge to you again if you need to include this emotional component in the mess so as soon as a feature comes out your mouth imagine a customer asking you why why is Lent important why should I care why does it matter to me what does that mean to me almost like an annoying child who just ordered a pixie stick at midnight on Halloween you now as a case of wire rear imagine yyyyy not force you to come up with the answers again it's one of those things where you build momentum write out 1020 or 30 reasons why feature benefit matters to me it is that important to your business in your ability to create awesome copy find an emotional connection never treat is when you do this exercise you don't find the emotional connection with the first thing you write down it happens after you work your way to the easy ones and force yourself to keep going when you get past the superficial level and start drilling down below the surface then your tap into the true emotions emotional connection is how you turn lookers in the buyers it's how you turn buyers in the raving fans and it's how you turn your raving fans into customers for life so that's the secret to what really sells people it's not what you think it's what they feel some people by animotion and then justify with larger the prime personal motivations to buy fear and desire you should strive to make an emotional connection with your prospects and bars by turning your product or service was many different reasons why as you can well once again thanks for the plug but you're right it is you got to go on a motion you you know that one is a great chap and I don't have anything to really to add to that one other than you have to figure out what is the emotion tied to what you do exactly and that's what really sells people in secret number 10 in secret number 9 really go together for you know but I kept I separated it out because it's not just the emotion it's not just a y in Bullet it's the Wi-Fi throughout the if your if your if your conscience of that then it makes it so that you put it in you insert it more than just in at once back and put in your head why can put it in the captions on your pictures you put in the story that you tell people in the PS when you're closing your sales letter you put it in the words that come out your mouth when you're making a video so you got to be conscious of that so that's why it was similar 10 9 and 10 or really close but they needed to be explained separately as well hello what to do one more secret number 11 why good enough makes you and keeps you pour in the quote is the Enemy of Great Is Good unknown not know who said that what am I really meant was was a successful real estate agent some people thought it was part of the reason was that he would not accept anything other than totally excellent get a sign on his door that said the Enemy of great is good that always stuck with me when something is good enough you'll never be great how does this apply to sales copywriting a piece of sales County works we tend not to touch it because we get superstitious or scared we know it took everything work to get it to this point words making a smell the fear is that if we change the copy it will break in stop working and maybe not start working again when we change it back no let's say for example for every dollar you spend you bring in a back Turner but when you're about 52 so it's good enough and you don't want to mess with it at about 52 you're making a 50% profit margin but that mindset actually keeps you poor only once in 25 years of writing copy have I seen an instance where the original headline in the original copy could never be beaten better result here Santa's works you have two versions of your car the a version and the beavers you rang the test for awhile preferably a test I do a measurable result measurable results like total sales clip subscriptions etc if the be version beats the a version the Beavers and becomes the new a version now you have a champion in your tried it out do that new champion with a new version they called this champion that control sohaib Eastwood testing tries to constantly improve your best car be and make it converts refer back to the example on secret number six word change the headline in my sales increased from 0625 sales in 2-minutes of 500% increase another example introduction talked about changing a website from 20 pages to one page and sales increased by 250% me ask you a question what if I had made changes would you be reading this right now tell no I'd still be living in the trailer Park delivering newspapers if I have not made those changes we never would have made the money that we made my life would have been completely different so it's critical that once you've got something working you must test to make that copy better little incremental improvements can produce massive profitability let me give you $100 product details and don't let your head spin with this matter I'm going to keep it as simple as possible but say for example u108 product for sale with a 1% conversion rate on your sales letter that means you make $100 for every hundred bizot who come to your website so 100 visitors x 1% conversion = 1 sale at $100 now let's say cost you $90 and advertising to get 100 visitors to your website that one's no I was seeing you selling an eBook or something with no physical delivery costs so that means you spent 19 hours on traffic you made $100 in sales your gross profit is $10 let's start test your profitability what have you tested a few bullets and raise the conversion by 1% what have you tested the offer itself and raised conversion by 0.15% what have you tested the simple picture at the top of the page and raise conversion by 0.25% what you did all those and had those tiny little increases now you're converting at a rate of 1.7% nothing else has changed in your car so you increase your profit my 700% you're making a 7-day $70 profit vs a $10 profit do you make n170bx for every hundred visitors instead that stinking 100 you were so happy with before you started test headline that doesn't do as well you just turn it off it's not like you're a loser if it doesn't work as well as the first version go back to your original champion in start looking for a new Challenger my body Russell brunson book 108 sweat test winners details over 100 TAS is company did to explode profits Skyrocket sales in Croydon Avalanches subscribers you can get the book for free you'll have to pay shipping in hairline A copywriting secrets That can/free split testing by the way all this testing used to be super complicated and technical to do which is why few people did it but now it's incredible tools like clickfunnels it's easy to implement a bespoke plastic there plug-in software and services out there that make it an expensive the test it's easy to set and you must do ab split testing with everything including your headlights your office your prices your bonus is your email subject lines your call To Action to order button text and your colours you can test what is a more however here's the number one thing you need to understand you never test more than one variable at a time if you're going to test a headline test one against another but everything else on the page stays the same if you're going to test the text on the order but then that's all your test and everything else on the page stays the same as soon as you start changing more than one variable at a time your test results become invalid user to automate the testing process whatever using for your website see if there is a built-in ab split test feature if not then go out and find a tool do a Google search for AB split testing tools and find tons of options you take away on the secret is this start test start test one thing at a time don't accept the results you're getting now as good as good as it's going to get think about it is operating at a 10% profit margin Imagine by doing a simple test on your website your flyers and your ADS you increase conversions by Tiny percent in you explode your profit what would that mean your business in your family for many syns margarine company's it's totally life-changing so much hidden properties right there waiting for you just by testing a few simple things you can afford not to do this summary if you're not testing start testing immediately never test more than one variable at a time test for actions like purchases clicks or subscriptions automated testing don't do it by hand if at all possible a run a test for depending on your email traffic you get to get ideal you want to run a test based on purchases and you want to do it I typically will try to do like to 100 purchases so if one version gets me 45 purchases and another one gets me 55 purchases the 50 51 win if I run a test and one version gets me 45 purchases in another one gets me three and I can wait till I get to 100 on one side and 6 on the other to know that the one with the 45 is winning so typically I want you try and get to 100 100 clicks 100 afternoons r100 purchases and the guy that got 80 - in statistics but it's funny how all these rules make sense when it's your own money on the line which spend I use some common sense to now the one where they not do it is going for a date around the filter headline for a day and you know that that is meaningless also looking at different sources of traffic so I got 100 visitors and had a 3% conversion rate in it was from call Dad and arrange this other one again Hunters but they're all from my list and I had a 12% conversion that's not a valid test right though it should be as they call homo geneous traffic meaning it's all the same same as possible so so yeah that makes sense next all these secrets are blending in together very nicely and creating a foundation of knowledge for everybody you should feel like you're getting smart with every one of these chapters in that I know I am just sitting here listening did Richard read the book there you go awesome I guys well we will see you in the next session titles or headlines headlines headlines Toys R Us elbrook Simon the title mode headline the headline that book page of mine that several book pages in mind that I have changed and just use the weather and then I went in hit some emotional side to you I did one of those imagine this you show up and you but so it was really in a hit I'm so sorry booked this weekend and I think I ever have any weekend wow this is Labour Day weekend so this was a major holiday weekend when people normally are not there outside party I guess you I think people try to catch up on the internet sometimes on the weekends you have noticed it's kind of weird that we used to send newsletter on the weekend you'd send them the week Spain border would be all crazy on Monday so you wouldn't send them those days cos they get caught in the spam and delete but you want some on the weekend people were at work or one at the computer but now it seems like with social media people try play catch up on the weekend in the Bible time so I think things have an evolving a little bit with the timelines in some of the old school mentality of when you send newsletters and when your post social media sales and things like that this would you would you mind sharing the exact stuff that you wrote on one of those don't mind do you want me to do that right now yes yeah I'd be curious I don't know if you remember what it said before hand but I be very curious to hear what the one of them said I will do that so I know I changed like some of my Navy SEAL pages so here we go start today and baby PST get to went through the training that's the new headline imagine this you arrive at Birds I'm sure if you're fully prepared but after a few days you realise you got this is programs will do that for you the journey will

of training in the middle are you durable and you have work capacity that's good stuff thank you but I was very excited about it that with you that's like really good thank you I like it your wizard help me create it at awesome well and hopefully some what you want incorporating secrets ok I'm listening cool people listening people that that's all that was really girls like me and you need to write something like that for all these over 50 you need that you need to write you now you want to whip up on the young guys you want what type of that lady yes that's awesome thank you so let's continue secret number 12 don't reinvent the wheel great copy Leeds close and you need to do the right research before you start creating your sales copy why so you're immersed in the mine said the people you're targeting with yourselves messages now what type of research would you need to do what do you need to know what do you want what do they want more than anything what are the big desires what are their fears what scares were there objections to buying stuff like what you're trying to say you need to find out these things what do they wear their fears what are the objections to buy either you or anybody who's selling out there if you do that you have a massive massive it managed over the other people creating sales messages look at the sales messages your customers in the marketplace look at the number one best selling books on Amazon that target your audience read the back of a car look at the chapter title see the sales messages used to get these people to this process is called funnel look at with charity working with the sales copy and then apply that what you're doing with your products and services you don't steal what others are doing but you do marrow have the approaching and selling to the market place where do you research Amazon is my number one source for research not only can I see what people are buying since Amazon has everything listed in category is a best sellers but I can also look at the comments that people make with their feet people because quite frankly the 5-star people are often just been boys in the one star people are just better Note also hate life the two three and four star people explain it did this which was good but it didn't do this which I use their words to help write Yourself what's your selling a product about how to speak Spanish you know this people complain that a popular product doesn't teach you conversational Spanish instead it sounds like you're learning straight out of a class you so you can use that feedback call yourself in on which include on your own to emphasise how your product uses conversational Spanish use that angle in your head album conversational Spanish in aslist to wear those of the things you find out when you do the research you have to immerse yourself in the sales message is customers are and how they reacted Google is another great resource if I want to solve a problem I search Google to see what comes read the blog post look at the ass look at the key words people use in the related products look for the ideas people share in black person articles look at the questions people ask it might take a couple of hours or even a couple of days to immerse yourself it might take you a week depending on your schedule and how well you know your audience but it'll be the most valuable couple of hours couple of days or a week that you'll ever spend this reaches research is how you see the words people use and connect with them in yourself put available out there look at the sales messages in the feedback especially for products and services that are popular with your target audience in research gives you a direct way to take advantage of where your competitors are succeeding and we're therefore it automatically positions your offer as a unique and better solution just by understanding the market through research the DVD in watch it but they didn't pay attention to the slides I made using snagit as the example they skipped ahead and watch the power of the training ratio the final presentation which happened to be an excellent presentation for but if they had watched the whole instructional videos they would have seen that I built a presentation in front of this confusion never occurred to me but I change some Burbage in part of the sales copy which cleared it it's a great example of why you look at the feedback from your competitors however you also look at your feedback to improve your own selfie mic compatible with exploded this issue to their benefit by saying something like and unlike other training we don't try to sell you anything extra we include everything you need to make amazing PowerPoint presentations and don't pitch any extra software even that was be yes and I wasn't pitching a competitor could a smoke me if they've been paying into another place to do research is your frequently asked questions that come in or your email support tickets those are nobody wants to read the negative feedback or objections but if it makes you a whole light wealthier the next enough motivation to do when you sit down the right you're copying research needs before writing sales copy is just do it get the words feelings and ideas directly from sales copy that engages to understand the reactions of people Amazon and other sites that allow you to look at reviews are your Gold Mines spending a few hours researching similar products how to get in the flow of creating the result is better sales copy written match summary never right cells can be without doing research research gives you the words and the Intel you need to write better only a fool such that the keyboard and start writing called copy without warming up first so that was secret number 12 any thoughts or questions about research to like the term hacking where did that originated originated inside of the clickfunnels community where in the first person ever herbs used it was Russell brunson where he describes the what's a funnel hacking where you go out and find a successful offer and you don't copy the person but you pay attention to ok what kind of a headliner they're using one emotions are they playing what is there page look like what kind of a page are they using are they using video sales order using the long-term sales letter you know what what's the price point what kind of colours are there even use in an also fine I can refers to going to all steps of the funnel what is the first step look like what is the next step look like what are there one time offers Equipe do they haven't ordered what are their price point was there firework gonna look like what kind of messages are they sending it tune is the sincerest form of Flattery right but plagiarism as a way to get enough and get your PPE you don't want to do that but you know anybody can also learn from other people's mistakes and that's why I'm looking at the reviews about people online looking on here as I'm looking where people not not the haters because haters just gonna hate temperature the people they love it no matter what because of that person 10% going to hate it because it's that person you're looking for the stuff in the middle where people literally say I wish it did this yeah the offer constructive criticism you know I saw the first thing I just came in my mind just now when I published an audio programme back in the day back back before it was easy to do and I published it and everybody liked it and then I I saw a post somebody had made in a forum because there was no social media back then and the lady said you know the only thing I wish about this is the gym had labelled his each one of the segments and named the files a certain way so that they would when I looked at them in a folder they would all be in order and I said oh crap even think about it just didn't even down on me so I went through and I rename done so that they would show up in in sequential order and then I sell people on that day when I first do this you need to jump on and because they're going to be your chance to ask me anything and help determine the direction of the product and it's like it's getting coaching for me without paying 1000 box an hour and so that's that's because people know that I'll do it and it but it's Jack's me how many people just wrote up now they're never paid attention the feedback and then move onto next time I see things all the time that you're updating inbox really easy pretty boxes no more of a challenge but you still could do that too but I mean I find it if I get asked the same question multiple times about a specific column in my workout is big and I did explain better in need of the program yeah just a change and fix their labs they're actually are in a shuttle run perhaps perhaps for you mass you could I ok so secret amateur teen it's all about them never about you simplicity is the ultimate sophistication Leonardo da Vinci make it simple make it memorable making inviting to look at make it fun to read Leo Burnett once you talk to your audience you turn to what your audience to see how smart you are you use industry jargon or big words you want them to know you know what you're talking about this tenancy happens no matter what you're selling if you're selling a drill you start talking about voltage and torque if you're selling a coaching program you talk about your 25 years of experience and how you know all these cool things if you're selling software you talk about gigabytes and use hard to pronounce words however you actually prove to people how smart you are by communicating with them they can understand when they can still track with you despite being carried confused and only partly paying attention that's when you prove how smart you are you do that by making it all about them making it all about them mean to avoid being cute using sarcasm inside jokes or using anything that could be misconstrued you avoid trying to prove how smart you are by using big words industry jargon acronyms you don't explain all that does confuse people in turn them off one thing I've learnt in sales is there a confused mind always answers know someone who's confused never agrees to buy maybe one in 1000 does but usually can't make money off a 1-in 1000 when you're making a sale that involves a lot of emotion with a person who is scared feel self-conscious believe they're going to get ripped off or is afraid of making a mistake it is critical that your communication is crystal-clear be very conscious of what you people in the mortgage business we learn to talk about complicated prudential staff in a way that made sense to people who didn't want to understand understand what we had to disclose for example one thing we had to reveal was the highest probability the servicer of their loan would transferred to another party but the principal was still owed in the interest would never change I took two pages of complicated disclosures and just explain the company you make your mortgage payment will most likely make your mortgage payment to will most likely change the only effect that has on you is who you make the cheque out to each month and where you sent it was so effective at cutting down people's anxiety that the BP the mortgage company had me do a training for the other learning answers on how to do disclosures that's what I really learnt to use my words are used words my target audience understood to help them make a good decision the consequences of not doing this is making people feel stupid if you make somebody feel stupid they won't buy from you if someone feels like you're making fun of them are talking down to them they won't buy from you if they feel like you're too smart for them to understand they won't buy from you and if you talk in circles and they get confused they won't buy from you so you need to use the words they use you need to talk in simple terms they understand you need to use short sentences you need to keep your darts well organised and sequential graduate from college all she knows to do when software doesn't work is too young for me to come to your office and these qualities make her the perfect person for me to give a piece of copy and ask hey would you read this and tell me where it's not clear where doesn't make sense she's actually have used my mother for that role as well find somebody who doesn't know what you know and get them to read yourself copy or listen to your video sales letter and see if they understand if they can understand it then you're on the right track and no they don't have to be a member of your target audience to be ineffective sounding board for yourself in fact it often helps a day art say hey it's pretty cool then you still have to work on yourself now of course my wife's not going to buy anything I'm selling so that's not a good littlest but you get the idea also most people use the copy to are in your target audience ever going to say hey where can I get one so that old saying only hold so much water in my if I had a boil the standard one big takeaway to this right or create your sales copy so it speaks directly to your ideal prospect write to a single person don't write to a group write to someone you know who represents the perfect person in your target audience remember Fred from Secret number 8 this trick works exceptionally well when you're stuck here is a true story my buddy George represents my audio if I'm stuck writing a sales letter video sales letter any piece of copy then I say hey George I got something you need to writing to George works well for email teases because I have a tendency to get detailed in my emails and make them 50 pages long when they only need to be 5 pages 5 Lines spell situation keep your messages simple and don't use big words and don't make people feel stupid it's not how smart you are it's about how much you can help you just it's all about them that's why I love when we were talking earlier and you read out that carb you wrote for one of your get ready for your bedspread books that is like that was really great happy because it had nothing to do with you and had everything to do with them and the emotional payoff they're looking for so that's that was a perfect example of why galaxite about that cos it's nothing to do with adaptor it was everything to do with them and what they wanted to get shall we keep going high secret number 14 the here you are you posted your you've written you created your software design your service on a sign on the door of your coaching business but you don't have any testimonials yet some people say this is a handicap they'll never over people get hung up on the stuff because they see other people using testimonials feedback endorsements and reviews in their sales copy but they don't have any yes testimonials can help you build momentum improve and improve the effectiveness of yourselves messages testimonials usually coming cells can be after you have made your plans and your offer so you've pulled them in with the headline you've around their curiosity with your fabulous bullets you've given them the information now all the sudden it's time to start thinking about making that purchase decision that's when many people will say well yeah that sounds good but I've heard this before why should I believe you you need proof that what you're talking about is significant and will work for that there are many different proof elements you can use besides a product specific testimonial now in an ideal world you and have a results-oriented testimonial which is from someone who use your products services or software etc would like for example for stew would be if you could get somebody like Marcus Luttrell the lone survivor or he could get the guy who popped Osama bin Laden or jocko willink or one of these are the guys who is a famous Navy SEAL to say you know what 15 years ago I bought any got me into the shape I need to get through buds and I never would have become the outstanding individual I am today had I not gotten but that would be the ultimate to maybe have all those guys sitting around a fire say you know I you still Smith book in at which actually is really cold because that happened that those guys but it guys sitting with those guys said that he used to his book while sitting around with Marcus Luttrell the other guy's name is Rob forget his last name O'Neill yeah I mean Lisa Lisa famous guys who were supposed not be famous but somehow they said lovely be famous and I'm the famous and small circles yeah because they had movies made of adamant national International bestsellers that's not a small circle dude that's good point that is true but if you can't get that do you have any other I could get them very easily I mean why haven't you have a pull that card yet why not no excuse I mean do you think you shouldn't are you still at Brighton on that you know the quiet warrior things well not really it's just haven't haven't gone there I may have a lot of great testimonials from guys written saying plenty of successes to rent their journey I just need to place them into the cells cafe in a few places I haven't done it all places another lesson children that I want you to take when you get testimonials don't just sit on music test put them in your car being see if they create see if they create an increase in response if you've got a bunch of them and you can't really stickman yourself.com you can certainly put him at the bottom of any sales copy all the way the bottom so just people can see line after line after line after line after line one of the things you can do with a testimonials like I said anytime you make a claim back it up with proof so if you say you know this is going to get you in the shape you need to get into to get through hell week and then you have a testimonial from a guy you know whatever but Class 2 numbers there are now the 253 on you know I made it through hell with everybody else was sucking wind exact let me tell you what it would have sacked a lot worse if I gone through and done exactly what's do told me to do in the birds bread course you know I was beaten up but I was at hell of a lot better after that other guys and my my boat crew consistently came in first we were always the ones who got the rest because we were winning the races so we got a total of 4 hours asleep during her week instead of to you know that kind of a test manual the back that's that's something when I think people miss the boat a lot with testimonials isab you make a claim it's fine to put a testimonial right there after you make certain intersperse you can even use a testimonial at the start of your sales letter especially if it's if some if you look and cement somebody read this testimonial dangerous by instalike so you can use them and Aladdin different spots but everybody should have in place and automated system for asking for testimonials so if you have maliweb panel you have a follow-up email sequence when someone dies from you just buy the first emails you send out should be a thank you for buying after they've had a chance to use it or maybe 6 months later you say I just want to say c did you ever do it in Nice did you how did it go would you give us a testimonial to help because it inspires other people what about you on the other hands do you know when these dudes are going through and when they graduate when they're excited you should make it feel like you're celebrating them because you are if you celebrate you know you've done the two through and after like you're also inspiring other people as well so it don't be ashamed to ask in a mat talking to Matt saying this direct with you I'm saying this to everybody if your stuff works which hopefully it does they don't be a in the ask for testimonials because the testimonial will inspire others and help others to get results so that's very good very good point what I have done in the past as I created a testimonial page so I actually have a leak of 5060 testimonials that I just cut and paste email samau telling me I just put it right into that section for that that book and create it and then through the link in there to for more information check out the testimonial page right that's what I have done in the past but I'm also pulled the exact quote out in put it right into sections as well that's good better is putting into individual pages and not worrying about why use this I use this quote on the seller pitch do you get one good testimonial use than ever related product you have as long as it applies that ok you can always do a page like what people are saying about Steve Smith and his and his training ok that's the bit long thing but when you have specific product testimonials that will work for specific page do not have a link in yourselves car because we might ask money yeah you're right there the only link anybody should be seen on a sales page is what kind of legs do the bye now bye now that's right time time in OK that was a little side but I think that's important results testimonials are the types you want but you have to be careful especially in areas of health finance banking investing and things like that their specific requirements for testimonials like that they're disclaimers and disclosures you need to provide you can investigate that on your own and attorney nor do I play one on the way but the authorities are particularly concerned with any claims made about hell or finances bottom line be careful and never manufacture a results-oriented testimonial how many take a timer again and just say the other thing you need to be careful of is if you get a testimonial for you actually gave somebody a product or you compensated somebody for giving you the test manual then you have to know that you have to say this person was provided with a free copy of the of the book of the programme with this person was compensated to come into our studio give us a video you can do that with an asterisk and stuff at the bottom but you do have to know that two people the other thing then you'll have to research this on your own again health and finances let's get real here until above gagri results in I know that if you take action you're going to get results as well but the truth is most people won't take action to most people won't get results I'm just told you write myself happy with the most people want Picasa most people get results my hope is that you're not one of those people but you probably would have read this far listen this four if you were one of those people saying that it's kind like you reverse psychology exactly another example for reverse psychology especially with us I'm not telling you you can make $1000000 because I can't tell if you will not I'm not telling you you're going to be able to buy a brand new Ferrari I'm not telling you you'll be able to pay your house off I'm not telling you you're going to be 6-ft tall 190 bulletproof and gorgeous Superman I can't tell you that but I can tell you that I will now when I just do I just told you straight up I can't tell you all those things are going to happen but you had to imagine yourself as every single one of those things would make an amazing dollars driving a Ferrari haven't paid for house being a supermodel and using that as the away to meet the government's requirements again on an attorney and not giving legal advice but you're telling them you can't tell them this but you've accomplished what you want to accomplish which was to make them think about hey because nobody thinks that they're the person that's going to fail everybody thinks they're special everybody thinks they're different so using reverse psychology in there Sunday we'll make it through the rest of the secret but it's fine to talk about these things you just ask people you've done business with or people who know you to provide a testimonial about you or your company so you can have testimonials on your website simply ask them what they would say to a friend or colleague about you and if it would be ok to put that code on your side it's that's the next testimonial is a celebrity endorsements the celebrity can be a notable figure in your net world for example in 2001 when I published the eBook that launched me into the online business Arena I received an endorsement from a German name Jay Conrad Levinson who wrote The guerrilla marketing books icinema copy of the book ask them if it's a couple of words about it any indoor that was huge by the way you've got nothing to lose by asking people you don't know if they'll review your send it to some people recognised by your target audience and see if they'll indoor shoe most of them won't you only need one or two say yes to change your life celebrity endorsements the next thing you can use a statistic that support what you're telling people they're returns of studies in statistics out there on anything you can imagine go to Google and into your topic plus the words that sticks or study here's an example we want to find some proof to support the sales message for my book selling your home alone you'd girl Google and search for for sale banner statistics according to the national Association of realtors 9 out of 10 for sale banners will fail give up in list with a real estate agent within 30-days so you can play at that in the procession and say the truth is according to statistics 9 and 10 for sale by owners will fail don't let that be you that's why you need this book leverage those statistics to give you the proof you need for the claims were you can also leverage quotes to help you build your Pro find some quotes that apply what you're trying to get people to do or use this quote in the appropriate places to instill trust into rainforest the idea that buy what you're selling is a good decision so if you don't have any testimonials yet you know I'm a bunch of different options for getting proof elements in yourselves me tell you a quick story where the things I did get testimonials from my first book selling your home alone what's the giveaway copies of my book two people who are trying to sell their houses themselves I handed it to them and said here's my I think it will help you if it does would you mind giving me a test money in please let me know if you have any questions I can help with that's all I said results received many testimonial letters for my birthday because I just gave it away and ask people to provide me with the testimony so how do you put the secret in the action don't let the lack of testimonials hold you if you don't know results-oriented testimonials then work your way down the different options I've given you find one to help you do what you need to do with the fastest way to get testimonials to hand out something to different people and Astrid testimony or endorsement either for the product for you or for the traffic in general don't let the lack of testimonial stop people get all worked up and say stupid stuff like I don't have any of these things so I won't be able to sell that's not true Will results testimonials help you sell more than likely yes but you can't sell more until you've sold something and you can't sell some until you get the damn thing up there and offered for sale in the first place summary don't like a testimonial stop you need proof to help them feel comfortable making the decision to buy from you proof comes in many forms including celebrity endorsements statistics and quotes that support yourselves message give your private the weight of people in exchange for an honest testimony that was secret number 14 and I had a bunch in the middle any questions or doubts to know I think we beat that one up pretty well really I mean the testimonials are important and well the biggest thing I would I wouldn't want to reinforce you guys that is answer that summary is automate the process of asking for them that's the biggest make it make it part of your process what do one morning sessions do they call eBay secret number 53 sales formulas that never fail if you

programming the study of how language gets people to take action first you start with the before life will be like in NLP this is referred to as futurepace imagine your life circumstances business manager whatever wants the negative is once you've painted that picture where they've solve the problem answer the answer the question remove the ROBLOX they gone from unhappy to happy now it's time to bridge your product to this happy for the Bridges here's the path to get there here's the product use the services the method here's how you're going to bridge that gap of where you are now where you want to go let's look at our dog training exam we start with the before so your dad's not listening your word that will get loose and run down the street maybe even running the traffic and get you making in a fight with another dog or he might buy the neighbours child which would lead to which could lead to some serious legal entities the after imagine what it would be like to have your dog

your sound of wonder why you're even together introduce the after imagine what your life would be like if every time you saw your status you felt the same feelings you felt when you first met when you

temperatures are the three formulas where can you use them anywhere in for any purpose where you want to start selling use them and tweets use them and use them and social media updates email teasers these formulas work wherever you want to start the sales process summary these three formulas just playing these formulas take people do a mental processes and set them up to be tested formula to find the one that works best with your audience that was secret number 15 any questions on out onto your thoughts I love that one that is the meat and potatoes of sales copywriter absolutely you got those formulas and it's funny when she understands then it gives you a framework to really frame anything like I said video This Morning where I use the before after bridge so I was talking about where people are right now and then I talked about where they could be as far as an ML tell you that thing I was talking about was just a warning people to take a certain action because of what's going on in the world right now with disasters and there's a hurricane coming and so I talk about how most people only worry about disasters when someone is talking about something on the news by the truth is a disaster is one leaky pipe away once build build cup of coffee one dropped phone one drop laptop when stolen computer away from crippling or destroying your entire business if you don't certain actions now imagine what life would be like if you knew and marijuana happens and protect it no matter what my data safe my work is safe and the most inconvenient part would be I'd have to go buy a new laptop in log into your website and download all my files that would be the worst thing that happened then life's pretty good so the Bridge to that is in the next plane the different things you could do anything but I was telling people on the night dear just to create a cool piece of content that people will look and go down that just good guy he cares about me kind of thing so that does formal learning is use this and they can become really second nature for you when you're talking to some people's like nobody there however pram they just want to call benefit will then you use the 3 x benefit that you know if you want this benefit benefit benefit then this is really the most important video you're going to watch in a long time so the user still example you know if you want to qualify for buds get a get a seal contract and feel confident that you're actually going to get through the training once you get there then this is the most important but you're ever going to read that's going to work much better than staying here you scared you're knackered be able to get to go to birds that might work but the other one is here if you want to get if you want to qualify for a contract if you want to arrive with With Confidence and if you want to be one of the few guys left standing at the end then let Me Explain you how you're going to be able to do that yeah that's good so but you understand what does three formulas are and then where to use them but sometimes you not know where do using until you try offering figure out the one that works best in there especially important at the beginning of yourself happy I've done sales letters where I just changed the the the 10th at the beginning of it the opening from Crumlin state song to the 3x benefit to the before after bridge in you figure out which one is going to work the best will tell me this is kind of a difficult question because you have a lot scripts out there available for people in Funnel scripts what would you say the Aldi's formulas would be probably the most used in your scripts or just by clicking a button is it testing at a different formula most of the time especially between the 3x benefit in the pram and dates of when you fill out one of the scripts like the ESL wizard when you feel that you fill it out once but you can choose ok give me the output with a promoted Saga give me the outfit with the great big benefit promise so there's I try whenever possible to give you those options just automatically so you got asked them side-by-side and we try and do that in the headlines and another selfie of the action between hat one called traffic so don't have to figure it out but you just focus on the important things identifying prams questions ROBLOX and results and then automatically we just give you those formula so you can just so you can modify the one you think so softwares the formulas are in the softwares correct saying yeah that's cool see you guys the next session hey guys and welcome back we're going to hit secret 16 it's all ice cream but what flavour should I choose you can have everything you want in life if you were happy enough people get what they want in that was by zig ziglar when it comes to sales letter she might ask what should I use a video sales letter along sales letter or short sales letter which do you think is best for people think that links matters answer this question I'll give you the personal injury followed by my professional answer is my personal insert start with a sales letter y well for me is the fastest way to get an offer up when I want to test an idea to sell something to make an offer or to launch a new Funnel anytime I go into the marketplace video sales letter is the fastest way for me to do this is how I structure the page start with the headline seems obvious doesn't it but as we discussed and secret number 6 the head manager most important piece of sales copy insert your video beneath the headline I buy button place right under the video in some cases are stop right there in others are at the following at four to six awesome Curiosity and using boats under the buy button give the guarantee sunrise without insert Another by button and then have your closing copy and the postscript in the postscript you're going to restate the main benefits stated in the video sales letter now it causes some people heartburn there an ever-increasing number of people online who rebel against videos playing automatically in Google Chrome browser has basically put the kibosh on auto playing videos with the sound turned on then typically we have a Buy button right under the video followed by 3 to 6 bullets about the product the software of the service underneath that we sometimes but those two where we met at the video and then the boards and then the buy button but typically my Bible is going right underneath the video we have a guarantee and we have the summary of what they're going to get so literally in the sunroom relist off that they're going to get this this this this this this and messing about it let me have another bye bye bye Mummy of the clothes and then probably APS and the PS again basically just restates the main benefits expressed in the video sales letter it's that's the paranoia used for anything under a couple hundred bucks now why do we use this it's quite a video sales letter is a 1-day project if you Beatles in Norwich it's easy for people to digest you ran traffic you see how people react to it in once the results in sales afternoons clicks or whatever the objective is for yourself cafe does this mean long for himself let her know absolutely not do not believe anybody who held the end of long-form sales letters I still use them because they're effective then why use the long can be if you start with a video silver well use the long carpets our higher priced item and if people need more information to make a purchase decision in my experience nobody wants to watch an hour long video sales letter billiton an hour-long webinar but they won't give you a link to video sales letter so in some cases you have to give people more information using long tells a 5000 hour coaching program using an 8-minute video and no application process you pay or don't pay at the end of the video typically the two reasons you use long copier when what you're selling costs more people need more information to make a decision so in this case typically what we'll do is start with the headline will do he will still do a sales video then we have the bye-bye let me have the one for himself letter underneath all of that so just because you using the long form sales letter doesn't mean that you don't use the video to by the way it's ok if the long-form sales letter duplicate what you share in the video sales letter in fact of actually scene with the video sales are and long-form sells letter with the exact date the line for himself that was basically just a transcript of the video sales letter or in other cases the long-form sales that was basically the Script used to create the video sales letter no why would you want to have about the video in the long-term sales letter on the same because people either watch the video or they read the long form this right now using a short sales letter makes sense when it's an expensive and doesn't require a lot of explanation if you did right longer copy some would say there are over selling this product something's going on here Barrowman my first absent in 99.9% of cases is a video sales now that was personal answer here's my professional answer is always going to get results then they tell others this is the absolute only way to do let me give you an example there was an internet Google who said read headlines don't work anymore at the time people believe your headlines should be he told everybody read headlines don't work anymore your headline should be but everybody change their headline colours to what happened many people's conversion rates went down a few people tested red vs blue headlines I was one of them in found that read headlines outperform the blue headlines on many of our sales messages taken over thousands tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands of visits the difference was remarkable no she didn't do any testing of the steering last month because they took someone else's word for it the one way was better than another learning patterns and formulas is good but the only way you'll know what works is to test the different variants and see which one works best for your audience traffic and offer I went to a parent because you did it before and get good results be careful that's when good enough kills your results I have to be cautious of this all the time when you keep doing it the same way and don't test you end up potentially leaving a ton of money on the table one more example upstyles for one time offers offers made after the initial sale as part of a sales Funnel to increase the overall profit for customer I do this consistently now why because after 10 years of selling the same product I had a one-time offer to it and immediately signed 30% increase in profits not happened I want to slam my head in a card why because I saw the sales jump from the one-time-offer mentally went back 10 years and calculated all the money I left on the table to the tune of $980,000 over the years Armagh test to see if a video sales letter is going to work better than the alternatives I recommended you start sales letter using the above format but you need to test when ultimately works best for you and your audience so you know for sure we'll get you the best results summary if in doubt start with a video sales letter in the end you have to test long vs short vs video to find the best action beware of anybody who deals in absolutes when it comes to sales copy the only way they know anything for sure is to test and beware of Falling Into the Trap of only doing things one way especially if you've gotten quite good results from in the past so do any questions or doubts on this one that's a very good description of what sells letters are and I like your building blocks explanation of those saw a couple things come together from previous podcast you've done when you were mentioning the sales letters but he can't go wrong with testing that is the only way you can't go wrong with a fitness to is like I have a waitress not the way that we need to find a this way is going to work for it doesn't make Andrea just figured out but that's testing but you're in the only way you're going to know for sure what kind of results you getting his to measure and test literally weather whether you're talking about headline you talking about being able to do push-ups if you don't want PT test you don't know and you don't measure then you'll really get figure out of what you doing is working better worse than what you were doing the same thing with the headline or a price for graphic anything like that ok so let's move on the secret number 17 how to ride an amazing cells that are fast it is profitable or unprofitable according to it's actual sales and that's a quote by Claude wanna write an amazing sells water fast than you need to learn the 13 parts of a sales letter I like to think about 13 parts as LEGO stacked one on top of another in this case there you go from the top down instead of from the bottom when creating your my focusing on the 13 different parts you don't feel the pressure to ride and tyre sales letter all you do is create each of these parts intern which makes it easier to complete doing 13 small steps is more attainable than doing one giant cells message project you can spread these and as you have time especially if you're a part-time entrepreneur here's the key Concepts the job of each part is to move people onto the next part of the sales think of yourselves letter a step men's across a stream one stone leads to the next to the next into the next if you miss one then somebody is going to get in that make it to the other side where they buy another way to think about this is like an old fire buckets the fire truck pulls up with just a barrel of water then 1015 or 24 min past the back at Filbert water one-by-one to the next person in line if one of those farm and goes down and gets outline the whole thing starts work in the building Burns to the ground think about each of these parts in order taking their turn passing the headlines the first is your headline package which can consist of a pre headline headline and subheading example attention of Funnel hacks how to get all of your sales letter scripts webinar slides written in under 10-minutes without hiring an expensive copyright this work even if you hate riding and never want to know anything copyright just remember the purpose of the headline is to attract attention from the real people then if you think about the actual letter it's going to say something like from the desk of your name and regarding tap so for example could start with from the desk of Jim Edwards regarding how to solve all your cells can be problems at the click of a what have we done in that headline package we grabbed our attention told them who the letters and also told them what this letter is about in just a few words now in a video sales letter what matters most are the first words that come out of your mouth for example you need to ride an amazing sales manager marathon the next couple of minutes I'm going to show you had a great sales copy fast your headline in a video sales letter or spoken script is those first couple of sentences so the first part grab their attention then you identified yourself and finally you let them to expect shocking statement II black is a shocking statement most people are parade in the hypnotic state they barely paid attention to what you're saying or what they're seeing a reading your man is distracted by things like I should go check this for hey I wonder what's going on over on Twitter birthday and wonder what's for dinner tonight all of these distractions assault their brains your job is just so they stop what they're doing in pay attention the you you do this with a shocking statement or image now it doesn't have to be something like Haley flash you open up my trenches type of thing that would work for some sites but in this case a shocking statement might be something that goes against something they hold true or expose something nice expect is to use a did you know statement to do this for example did you know most people who try to write a sales letter film miserably it's true so may go bankrupt and lose their houses here's another one did you know the number one reason people get turned down for military service is not due to a criminal record because they are considered too fat to train average for sale by owner sells for over $59,000 less then home so bye realtek all crap now that's the reaction you want from your reader or listener to have you want understand what they're doing and pay attention to every word you're sure define the problem now defining the problem uses a formula called problem agitates of which we discussed in detail in secret number 15 are the other formulas yes is this the easiest one to do absolutely is this the one that will most likely make you the most money quickly you when you define the problem you tell them in no uncertain terms the exact problem you face you can start with the word here's the problem you face you can use that exact wording and just fill in the blank you stated in no uncertain terms here's an example from the Military Fitness niche here's the brand new face as a society we become so sedentary people don't know how to get in shape and stay there the ultimate Bullet for me however instead of evoking a positive feeling in this case we use it to crush their soul exam which means you'll never get a chance to serve in the armed forces and serve your country which means you're struggle with being a fat can't potato for the rest of your life and never live up to your full potential which means you'll never share your message with the world in when you dye your message dies with you want them to say oh Dana hurts that stings ok you got my attention I don't want to die like that save me now this process does not have to take pages it's a one-two punch and a bar fight will be in a bar fight they didn't know they were having you smack somebody in the mouth hard enough you've got their attention you have to him again what you smack him in the mouth and made it worse so luckily for you there's no solution let me introduce you to Black are some examples luckily for you is now a solution introduce you to the PT test survival guide a brand new book to help everyone pass their next ptt likely for you there's no

how many boards do you need when my opinion for most purposes you need about 6/8 or 10 rocksolid bullets nobody wants to read 100 bullets are there exceptions to this rule yes but 10 good ones is going to kick the butt of mediocre ones so if you want to get good at bullets fast review secret number 9 the ultimate bullet 110 the who what where when why and how your qualifications to bring them the solution on the flip side the guy who invented the perfect push-up in the perfect pull-up this credibility statement in 1-minute infomercial by saying invented by Navy SEAL those 5 words were not to establish all the credibility he needed to say 100 million dollaz worth of fitness equipment bottom line at this stage and yourselves letter answer the question why you prove prove the answers the question why should I believe you use your testimonials and endorsements Now use whatever you have at this point statistics quotes government studies etc to established it's easy to introduce this by saying but don't just take my word for it take a look at this that's always a great segue into the section one type of Proof we haven't talked about his pictures and graphics images of why the best forms of evidence but they also one of the most regulated photos of compel where are also easy to fake think about weight loss before and after pictures superpower many of those pictures are fake a dirty little secret is that the before that picture is actually the after picture in other words people grabbing old image of themselves when they were skinny take a picture of themselves now is heavy and then flips the Pit and then put the pics it's a nasty little trip in by the way don't do that if you're making an income claim you could show pictures of bank statements people show pictures of checks all the time especially in real estate investment sales copy people will show pictures of people with whom they've done business my best advice always tell the truth and back if someone said how you need to prove Israel in a coral could you do some of the offering of the price go for a coaching example this is a six-part coaching program that starts on this day it will be delivered weekly there will be time for Q&A the drill example 18-volt drill comes with a bonus 20 piece drill and driver delivered via ups and rides and three to 4-days whatever it is tell them exactly what they're gonna get when they're going to how they're going to get it and how much it cost me let's talk about pricing some people who say you should do a dramatic price drop when you reveal the prize in some cases people are immune to especially if you're not selling in person or on weather for example in the text data on web page when you aren't present to close the deal if you tell somebody regularly this is $399 but today you're going to get for $2.50 that's not gonna work their BS detector goes off before they finish reading the sense to see great example of great examples of price drops for everyday products sale look at Amazon every single product they sell will have a regular price that's crossed out and then there's a reduced price it's usually somewhere around at 10 that 30% discount also look at the colours they use and how they crossout prices etc you can say regularly is this price but right now it's just this you want people to feel like to getting a great deal in this is the place to do it as not saying that usually those who live by the price die by the price is the whole justification for buying what you sell as a low price you're really make provide value pricing but don't call don't fall into commodity pricing with the price alone wins the bar that the cheapest guy in town rarely makes money unless he's got one hell of a back-and-forth bonuses and Pat sweeteners if you have bones special savings extra service included or anything else to put them over the this is where you tell them about in this section you add more value to the offer maybe you throw in an extra something like a bonus report in individual consultation with you or anything that will make them feel like they are getting a fantastic deal on your offer be shared build up the value of the bonuses and show why they're such a valuable addition to your offer Marlon Sanders amen I deeply respect told me something that caught my attention and stayed with me for going on 20 years my life to this day I remember the Lipton tea bag tag hanging out of the side of his teacup as we stood there talking while the attendees at the event file back into the meeting with only one standing there when he dropped this knowledge bomb on gym if you really want to make your offer amazing take her competitors USP their unique selling proposition in turning into a free bonus with your offer in other words whatever your competitors are offering that makes them unique provide the same thing as a free bonus when people buy from that way instead of comparing unit your competitors in trying to decide between the two offers they buy from you because they see themselves getting everything they want without having to buy from anyone but you know I could write an entire book on what that is meant to me over the last two decades but I'll tell you what I immediately did with that no idea I was selling a mortgage education that was doing ok my main competitors at the time were mortgage software calculators so I went found a piece of mortgage calculator software I can buy the rights to in started including as a free bonus with my offer I told people they didn't have to buy a calculator from anyone else because I was giving them one for free myself and I never looked caution don't pylon about your crap bonuses for the sake of piling on a bunch of crap bonuses be strategically use those bonuses to create an offer that makes so much sense and feel so right that people would be insane the same that only we do it guarantee this unconditionally for 30 days but it doesn't show you exactly

one-on-one coaching you're going to get the internet access to the online training you're going to get the pushbutton software you going to get the audiobook version you're going to get blueprints in templates how you do this depends on what you're selling what type and quantity of cells campea using and where you're using postscript the final part of yourself what is the PS this is where you restate the benefits and tell them to act now by the way where did the PS4 come from the bank when people wrote letters with quill pens or type letters on typewriters nobody wanted to rewrite a retype a whole letter if they forgot to include something important that's where the postscript came it's it is the final step that you forgot to put the letter which are going to retype the whole day and here is where you reset the main benefits the reason I should ask now and then you tell them to buy example p.s. this time will be sold for $49 this introductory price of $29 is a buy it now before

direct Mail sales letter weather is written on paper displayed on the web or delivered to video these are the part you must hit in order in the order given by following the 13th step princess you

works for a one-page letter a video or 20 page letter remember the stack of the value if you want people to buy from that was secret number 17 how to write a killer sales letter fast so still do you have any thoughts or questions on this that was a lot of stuff to unpack there's a lot of stuff down packing their honest I have any questions about what you said because I think that by itself is just a great lesson for people to thoroughly understand but where did you come up with this chapter so I studied a lot of different people over the years I've read the book getting a lot of courses of sat down and analysed or lot of sales letters that I've bought from with that in them do really really well and all of them campaign contains the majority of these parts in this order all of them extolled these parts in somewhere in in some order the order may be a little bit different the emphasis may be a little bit different but in the end they were all they all had these parts in whole or in part no pun intended and so if you look at it really craves that slippery slide of grabbing people's attention and then while I say logically walking them through the sales process it also builds emotion through the process it justifies where it needs to because after you've talked about hate you know you got this problem you got this here's the solution cheers all the cool stuff it's going to do for you by the way this point you're probably asking you know who the heck is this person talking to me and then after you've done that someone else ok well this all sounds good but I really believe and that's when you hit him with the but don't just take my word for take a look at this and then it's like ok I'm ready but you know now they're like ok that sounds cool I might get this sometime and then you say by the way when you act now you're going to get all this stuff this is why you need to act now and they're like ok will be built upon this now you know you're making me a good you know this is expensive but now they even going to give me a break on the price if I buy right now and by then it's now you just got a clothes and you know letting you get right at the station and you got a real name into the boat and getting internet and that's really what the summary and then the PS does an intro and the money back guarantee with removing the risk how is how important is that do you think for most sales letter because I've seen somewhere that's in some without have seen some with a limited time like a 30-day money back guarantee yeah I think it depends on your traffic like I don't think it is important with heart traffic where the people know you and if you just say hey look we stay in my hand as you know we staying bananas if you're whatever reason and happy in 30-days just let us know what we find your money as opposed to someone who doesn't know you know when you make a point of the 30-day money back as people know they're going to get their money back people bitching after going to get the money back I can do a chargeback I can do all kinds of stuff but if you make a point of saying hello I want to point out now to your most most websites a 30-day money-back guarantee but I want to make a point this if this does help you write an eBook in a week if it doesn't show you exactly how to create an eBook that is superhot in your target audience in if it doesn't show you exactly how to get it published on Amazon and on your website and if it doesn't do all this and you can't do it within a week from the other perspective you can't make him delete Danny but you can tell him too but they're not gonna so I'll give you my back and you can keep it anyway they were going to keep it anyway and for someone who's going to rip you off on if you have a physical product and you say them you need to send this back and then we'll give you a refund are you really going to repack into this and resell it are you really going to do that so if you said that you know what if you're not happy with refund your money even refund the shipping so because I want you to be happy day that if someone goes rip you off for someone is unhappy it totally takes the window their sales as far as them having a right to ditch or right to go on social media in bit which is something you have to be careful up because even if you the product seller or write someone on social media raising hell is is not good for you even if people know the people that know then we'll know the door and ask her like the people that don't know them will pay attention and be like a couple people bitching about this on social media maybe I won't bite but if you see somebody bitching and then you can say hey you know we refund your money we even refunded your Shipping and we'll let you keep the product I'm I'm not sure what else we could do to make you happy in this situation at sounds like you're unhappy then it when you do that usually when people bit like that is because they didn't get a refund so if you give them better than refined and you just give them money just give the money back that that is the biggest thing that I've learnt over the last 22 years plus of selling online is that when you refund somebody's money it's like Jiu-Jitsu you you have totally removed their ability to bits yes and and 999 x 100 they go away and so I'm telling you right now if you're going to sell online you will encounter that one in 1000 who loves to b**** who only lives to b**** and will b**** no matter what you do but you can even defeat them by reef immediately refunding their money the point you anymore because this is what you're looking for now if you want it really be nasty if there's a competitor that you don't like you tell this person and I would suggest here's a list of people you might go check to see if they can help you and you give more the names of the people that competitors that you don't like them go by from now and have done that too but that's that's the big thing that you want to do is just refund the money and I do it all the time when I say all time it is like 1% about it's such a good feeling to just do it vs dealing with it over and over again and next thing you know your stomach is upset you getting angry right you're you're nasty texting and you want it in you know you should read when you're sitting there typing back you know one of those responses yes you can find yourself piping up my those responses delete the response because that stuff can live to really hurt you don't type up one of those nasty response just say you know rather than risk disappointing you further I have refunded your purchase and you can keep the product that that all the wind just goes right out of there so I usually that to like if there's an error in shipping around book am I just keep it and give it away as a gift will send it send you another right you know and then I got three more so anyway that is that chapter and so we're gonna we're going to stop here and we'll pick up in the next section Picasa rock and back to secret 18 how to write killer email to users fast good advertising is written from one person to another

your last pt2pt test coming up please subject lines will get the right people to open up the email and frankly will not interest the people who won't buy anyway Wednesday open your email to use or make sure to acknowledge them rather than making them feel like this is an email to a million other people that's why I like to make sure I'm using an email software program where I can use the person's first name in fill it in so the email starts with hey Craig hey Bob hey Mary if I can't do that then I put in something like hairy one or hi Phil Funnel hacker or something like that make people feel like they're part of the group and being acknowledged you always need to have some salutation to start it don't just dive riding then you want to hit them with the shocking state it is

link I'll see you over there thanks that's it remember 99-100 emails the only purpose is to like a link know where the most successful female teasers I ever sent to my own list of prospects was only a few lines subject this blew me away by Craig this was totally unexpected somebody just did a review and it's amazing you gotta check this out see you over there that was the whole email I sent the reader to a review someone did on a product of that was in people were swept up in The Curiosity of it now you may you have to be careful with this so you don't appear misleading and also say as an aside every single person that got that email knew who I was they were on my list they were subscribers a part something from me so it was like that they knew me as a person so I was sending them personally an email this won't work if people don't know who you are and Sherwood want to spend a send a spare message like that you shouldn't be a minute but I sent this I had a relationship with and they all of them knew who I was so it wasn't weird it was actually like oh don't you just sent me an email what is this all about they had to be careful with this so you don't appear misleading obviously you wouldn't use this type of thing with people who don't know who you are again that email but was sent to my own in-house a great email teaser breakdown like this great subject salutation banking statement to three or four bullets r2da four sentences to build your ass specific call To Action for what you want to do clothes with a personal note like hey I'll see you over there thanks that's it can you do a bunch different ways yes is what I just outline for you the shortcut where did absolutely and it's going to make your life a lot easier if you keep shaking size if you must air on the side of one of the other go with a shorter email as opposed to a longer one remember you're not pumping at the benefits of what they will see excuse me remember you're pumping at the benefits of what they will see not of what you're saying just like an email to user should be sure this is a quick secret with all you need to remember get their attention to get them to open the email acknowledge that use a shocking state provide two three or four bullets to build up your ass give us Pacific call-to-action Close with Elsie over there in your that's it and it works in virtually any situation when you consider that 40 to 60% and more of your reader's might see this message on a mobile device this is even more important they don't want to read it on a text but if they can get the basic idea and you get them excited serious there click over to check out your sales letter your video or whatever it is keep it short and sweet here's one final thought about email email is a personal way to communicate because it arrives in their inbox therefore they feel like they know you so the more you talk to them in the quick familiar language of a friend the better your results friends don't send friends 10-page sales letters in an email summary 99 x 100 the only purpose of your emails to get a clip from the right person keep it short concise an aimed at getting the click retention and builder curiosity to entice them to know you may send that email to a million people remember this they will each read it one person at a time write like you're emailing a friend or colleague so that was secret number 18 any thoughts now that's a great one I love riding emails I love getting emails and answering emails I answer all of my emails are usually send them to articles that have already written because I've already answered this same question which is a one-on-one match but it also gives me ideas to write new car so remote you should be really focused on some emails and treat it like a low mini sales letter in France whether it's a sales letter that selling people on taking the action you want undertaken the email which is to click to check out something else so whether this is an email to your broadcasting out to your group to announce a new book or whether it is an email you're sending out to try and get him to go respond to a video you did on Facebook or to View content video do a video sales letter where people mess up is they think that the email is to sell the thing that you're trying to say it's not you're selling people on taking the action which is the click and go check it out and you want a pre frame them so that they click and go check it out in the right state of mind and that's when I figured that out my sales went through the roof because I start trying to sell what I was trying to sell and I just focused on getting the click with the right frame of mind and that's that make a huge difference and it takes a hell of a lot last time to type of the emails the yeah it is big long thing when the whole purpose is just to get them over there while times people took themselves out of the sale when they put in too much information so I absolutely and you make a good point though about emails and stuff for a long time I can't do it now but when I was first getting started when I might list was small the return email address was my actual email address so when I did a broadcast it was actually my personal email address so when people reply back I saw every single response and I can't do that now just cause the it just takes too much time but when things were smaller and I was in I was a one-man operation I actually did do that 3-years okey-dokey so secret number 19 the hardest draught you're ever right there is a secret every professional artist knows that the images done being original is overrated the most creative Minds in the world are not as a specially created they're just better at rearrangement and that quote by Jeff point of course the hardest draught is the First Direct there's never a perfect time to write copy there's always something you'd rather be doing often when you sit down the right cab you tell yourself you need it in the next 10 minutes so you sit down at the computer turn it on open your word processor and stare the blinking cursor blink you think how in the world am I going to go from this blank screen to a sales message a headline a sales letter or a video sales letter script how the world am I going to do that the interest to think and write in back to secret number 17 a sales letter is nothing more than a series of pieces don't think I have to write a sales letter instead things through the chunks needed to create whatever it is you in the case of a sales letter first you need a headline you need a couple of bolts fell by an introduction then you do the pram agitates all for me next year I description of your product followed by some bullets explain the benefits next tell them a little bit about yourself now provide the proof that what you're telling works what bonuses can you add to sweet and the next build up the value name the price and then give a price now clearly stated call the action now time to summarise your fantastic offer and conclude the letter don't forget the PS4 you briefly restate everything and send them back to the call-to-action yes that's a bunch of parrots but when you think about it as parts instead of has a giant hole then it's a lot more manageable an email also as they are subject line salutation Grandma's types of Formula with the actual Saloon waiting on the other side of clicking the link in the email the video sales letter is nothing but a series of Charmed it's your grab on the apron magistrates of Formula the solution 5 called about the solution reasons to act now and a call to Action the hardest wrap your everite is the first draught that's why you want to use your swipe file to stimulate yourself and your creativity your Skype on provide models for copy that works don't look at a blank sheet see how you can adapt sales letter should Britain before sales letters other people have written headlines other people written other people have written in calls to Action other people have use your swipe file to get your mind the first draught is why we invented Funnel scripts with funnel scripts all you do is fill out an online form Waka button and copy and paste it takes that it takes away the blinking cursor on a blank page and makes writing sales copy as easy as answering some questions something down on paper it's 100 times easier to edit and rewrite than it is to write from scratch once you sit on paper or your screen your mind put it all together and says I should say this I shouldn't say that but with this over there and we need another guarantee know and we should your picture here we need to have this here and that they're remember that all sales copy jobs are combinations of building blocks in a sales letter is a headline package yourselves story some bullets a guarantee and your call To Action or the other little parts in there of course but if you think about these main building blocks it takes away the anxiety of writing a big sales letter your number one job when creating a piece of sales copy is to get the first draught or version done is fast as you can that is the key to your success summary get the first draught on his bastard you can use your swipe file to help you get it done trading from scratch once you have the first draught at 100 times easier than than it is to write yeah love this one Jo I mean that's yard gets to get started and get something on paper it's something done in a lot of times what I've found is that if I can go read something this is typically what I'll do is I'll go read something I read somebody else's copy I read man can't be all and then I had a time because I've got these formulas internalizing I'll start talking and soul early I'll jump jump on zoom zoom like with you or I'll jump on with my team other team members or something else ok so this is why this is basically with the office going to be and I and I just start talking it out to get all the parts out and then I'll go stroller in my case I'll go for over in the funnel scripts because I'm the funnel and the number one Funnel scripts power-user on the face of planet Earth and I'll start using that because basically Funnel scripts is my swipe by it's my electronics whitevale combined with artificial intelligence and all the other stuff and so so that's what I'll do that that is typically I will do I don't dig out my papers White Band nearly as much as I used to with all the stuff that I've done before and clippings that I have but you can do that to in the key is just to know what Formula what blueprint you're using and just start busting it and we talked about momentum when you're when you're writing bullets the first few bars going to suck so you gotta get but you gotta get pasta stuck in so you can have the good box it's like when you're warming up to work out me the first 2 to 20 push-ups and pull-ups art that pretty but once your muscles are really warmed up then you can start fasting amount that be online ok let's do another one in the session secret number 20 make a more thirsty the sign the effect you want to have introduced in your reader Robert Collier you probably heard the saying you can lead a horse to water but you can't make him drink that is in fact you can't check you can take a chihuahua outside to go party but you can't make her you can bring someone to a specific point to do what you want them to do but you can't force them to do it however you can make that person more thirsty for what yourself so the question becomes how can I create content that makes people want to buy without giving away so much that they don't need to buy for people who sell digital products and services this is important in fact that he sent off for anybody sells anything what you need to do is get people position to buy from you but you also need to make you more thirsty so they buy fast here's a distinction you have probably never heard before most likely her the same story sell however I've found stories make people thirsty that sells can't be tell them where to buy a drink what you think about that for a second stories make people thirsty then yourself happy tell them where to go to buy a drink there four different types of stories you tell people when were thinking about content for your blog or social media or sales copy stories you use on sales letters are in a video there's no difference between them it is your intention that makes the difference first stories coming actual stories you tell about your life your business other people or anything that illustrate your PT II Stories can be case the Witcher stories about how somebody got a result in has beginning middle and end for instance I was here I wasn't happy this is what I did with the product and these are the results out it's actually a three-act play it's just like the Hero's Journey I was here had a problem is fixed it in this is where bird examples can be stories as well this is showing people how something works has something was applied as something was putting motion and then the results that you can use what I call the free ends of which are pure gold that can potentially change your life people are always looking for ways to give eyeball continent that doesn't completely solve the problem yet creates the need for what you're selling it increases the urgency to buy right now the first m stands for dispelling a myth people believe many minutes you can create massive amount of content such as blog posts articles videos and entire webinars in back hole books have been written around miss people believe and the banking of those maths understand the third m stands for mistakes mistakes are where you point out where other people going wrong mistakes are the most powerful of the three because nobody wants to make a mistake since we were little kids we believed believed if you make a mistake you're going to get a background on your paper you're gonna lose a point on your test or you're going to feel stupid no I don't want to look stupid so they will do anything to avoid mistakes you can create stories around misconceptions of mistakes without providing any solution that is part of your product however when you create stories with the three aims of contact people will feel like you've been spilling the beans all day long and as a bonus for you I said there were four stories you can tell there's actually a fifth way to make people even more Thursday using stories created from what's called future pacing these types of stories explained what life will be like when they take specific actions you explain how your product service software whatever will help them achieve those results you paint the picture my telling the story of their life when they do this here's an example I want you to imagine having your own unique book with your name on it as the other you hold that book up you show it to people they live through the pages they see your name on the front of the other it has the same Crowley cover designers any New York Times bestseller now imagine hitting about to someone you're trying to get the higher you to provide a Service during a job interview you include a copy of your book with your resumer your the trade show hanging out all graph copies of your book what everybody else in that business cards think about what your life would be like when you have your own book to give out to people how will this boost your credibility what will your business look like how you feel about yourself obviously having your own book is something that's important and valuable to you and your business so what have I done that I told the story that can be used as a Facebook post to blog post or even a live video there are pictures emotions and all kinds of things in the story but haven't actually taught you had a I haven't done anything other than just make you thirsty to create your own book if you have it already 8 on a Saturday morning the gas shows in the boat confirmed yet it's free you just have to hold it off the buyer says ok I'll take it then this ourselves one more thing I get a trailer over the boat will fit on if you like to have it I'll send you the trailer and I've also got this outboard motor over here but I'll tell you if you like to have an outboard motor for the both were think about this for a second you're still getting a free boat but to use it they need a trailer to transport in a motor to drive you can give something for free your client will love it but you do it in such a way that it set up the need for what you're selling when we give me another example John shoulder top Notch sales trainer tells everybody she is speaking coach what he teaches is the most expensive pico training in the world when I went through it was 25000 hours John sells escorts in this you paid in 5000 hours that attended is training in then you agreed to giving 50% of your own speaking fees until you pay them another $20,000 that was the day John was an excellent trainer the principal came home to me when John trained because it's whole speaker training was about how to make money from your speaking gigs heat on an excellent free training on how to create a hydraulic product you would sell from the back of the room

of these things in your consciousness at all times so it feels almost like you go back and read discover that stuff over and over and over again because you can only hold like it's like rain in on

and I've been going down with my car be lately and my teaching at the really going down this one lane of you know you got a focusing on the problem the problem it's all leading with the problem because of traffic temperature and stuff and then I looked back at some successful offers that I've made in the past and realise that with cold traffic there's nothing wrong with that and so you just want to test which works best so I just this is been really good for me to refresh myself on some things again that that I know and then you kind of taken for granted and you do them consciously and then it becomes automatic but if you told me remove the consciousness of these things then it starts being automatic could you just get out of the Habit so it's important to understand then and I actually need the pension income yes that's very true but you know there is so much information in here that you have to use this as a reference to write so you looking for ideas make a secret and really actor and keep going back yeah as you're going through it pick the ones that you think and have the biggest impact for you the quickest us can like working out your your push-up send your abs

no money in the middle came for you know she said it first the people in the mirror don't make any money they are so busy trying to appease everybody that they never do anything noteworthy for any particular group if you look at politics in the United States we have a two party system and have for a couple hundred years the names of those parties have changed a few times and the positioning of those parties has flip-flops a couple of times but it's an ass vs dementors that's how people think it's not right or wrong it's just the way it is you're either with them or with us the objective

it by taking a position and being consistent with your message your methods your opinion who you like into you don't even though you don't talk smack about people by you can talk about behaviour you can discuss practices you can talk about methods you need to have a position this is right this is wrong this is good this is bad this works this doesn't work people are looking for a letter for someone that blazed the trail for them they want someone to tell them this will burn your hand Littlejohn don't put your freaking hand on the stove or haystacks little bunny rabbit soft and fluffy and we'll make you feel wonderful if you are looking for someone to tell them their version of the truth to give them the right story to guys and be consistent about it that's why customers get so irritated with people that have the newest greatest thing of the week and why those types of marketers are sellers are promoters have to spend more time trying to replenish their list then they should because they're always coming out with the next greatest you need to be consistent tried to change Direction if the world changes of circumstances change if something makes urea voucher reevaluate your opinion then you need to tell people this is as an aside this is an example when I was talking about before with the secret before we started reading I was talking about the video I made today where I was telling people hate you know I've kinda re-evaluated what I've been doing I have not changed my position but I've seen myself doing something that I want to caution you against and kind of rain it back in people did it when you do that you selling something like hey I've changed my opinion about this I've changed my practice but don't be wishy-washy don't be like the wave on the ocean getting tossed around you need to stand firm let's let's look at this quick example for many years we did article marketing which was our primary way the drive traffic to your website every week I created an article and promoted it using a service called submit your article article in different announcement sites on the web which grow the visitors a week to my website at the time it was the only thing I thought to get traffic one day it stopped working Google changed its algorithm they start counting all those articles because people did spamming articles of moulineaux Val you business is operating with the philosophy love me hate me there's no money in the it flooded me I'm never forget hearing that for the first time it's made a dramatic impact of my business because this Pulaski gave me the courage to stand up to people who were saying things that were true this Pulaski gave me the courage to change direct it gave me the courage to share my opinion because of this will ask me I know if the situation was so that was secret 21 that's a great one that one speaks for itself yeah it is so concise perfectly stated that the one thing that that I have found over the years though is that the more polarizing you are can be almost like a drug and you can take it too far what you want to do or what I have down the happy medium for me I used to do this thing called the Friday Night Smackdown and I haven't done it for years but it was so polarising that there are people that still remember a junior did the Friday Night Smackdown and I this is the way back when I was in the little white house Attwood beyond the Trailer Park and I would do a Smackdown of something that's all going on or somebody pissed me off or something and it was really extreme and some people loved it but it was so strong that I started to lose customers like it was causing me to have to issue refund because people saying me and this is too much and if somebody went out for a refund over something my dad I can only imagine how many other people were just to blown away so where are kind of dial that back is I'm like the foul mouth uncle that you're not sure about at family gatherings he might say something funny or I might say something naughty but we never ever answer his call on speakerphone because you never know what he's going to say their first words that again come out of his mouth and 90 times out of 100 it all works out ok but it's that underline current of I'm using about what I might do that for me is the perfect balance for me because quite frankly to you now and we've known each other now four what's 6 years more than 67 years that's that's what you want cos I knew not fake it you're just amplifying your personality you have to remember who you were on stage when you talk to somebody or whatever just you just be a 5 version of yourself so likes to my take on Stu's persona is that he's the former Navy SEAL fitness expert on suburban just mellow suburban dad that he ever did raise his voice or yellow I would be mortified like a little child who got yelled at by a priest or and not it just because I know the every once in awhile he loses it but I've never seen it but I don't ever want to see it and in specifically I'm talking about like putting out when exercising in wind sure it occurs every now and then but you're right it's much more useful when it's not done all the time it's gone across quick so secret number 22 old am I got have that is long been my belief that a lot of money can be made by making offers to people who are at an emotional Turning Point in their lives Gary halbert the number one key to selling my crazy is the Promise any profitable product makes whatever sales can be your assembly 99% of the time your headline is your number one most important component the promise of any product or service often containing at helpline is the number one key to selling like crazy as with any sales copy there's a formula for creating a profitable promise in this case it's a four-part for me they are 12 the prize the timing in for the Eliminator let's take a look at first you must address people's concerns or questions about what they have to do to get what they want when someone looks at your product or service while you tell them hey this is going to help you get the result you want they think ok but what am I have to do to get that result your job is to understand the thing they want see as a hard thing to do which is the hurdle the result is the thing they see on the other side anime beautiful women vs had a beautiful women vs had a fine beautiful women do you see the hurling the action the ability to take the action to get the result is what they see as actually holding them back this action create a mental image people visualise actions best because the involves motion in 80% of your brain Focuses on handling what you see secondly you process motion most with your article hardware when you imagine it internally or see it externally that's why when you see movement at the corner of your eye you turn your head your wired up to do that therefore we want to give people mental images to literally and figuratively turn their head inside their mind so right to publish had a create how to use had a access what do they want to do what is the action or verb that they Desire how to lose 20-lb how to paint your house had a train your dog had a teach your kid to lift the toilet or your husband is my wife would say the actions are the hurdles part to apprise the prizes with the person wants it's also known as the result you want from taking action in the previous example you want your own outrageously profitable eBook and start royalty chats you want a passionate relationship you want freedom from back pain you want to go off like a seasoned pro again pay attention to the result keywords unit using some example had a drive a golf ball like Tiger Woods had a hit a golf ball like Arnold Palmer had a strike a golf ball like a veteran April for some audiences they know who Arnold Palmer is but they're more familiar with Tiger Woods or Saints need you need understand the words they use for the prize when you start crafting and using the formula to create your profitable product promises part 3 the time answer the question when will I get what I want because many of us are highly functioning 5-year olds wondering when Santa Claus is going to show up and give us what we were so even though you're in the door your interview the screaming when I get it when will it show up how long do I have to wait I want it now the timing part of the formula is where you give a time frame they can wrap their heads around that answers their questions when will I get it will it be an hour in afternoon a day or weekend or a week how long will it take your two ways to present time first you reference the time for them to get the prize by taking action themselves the key is that it should be almost unbelievable but within the realm of possibility so they can only blame themselves if they don't examples timing right 100 page book in about a week 100 page eBook in 7-days is very possible I've done many times it can be done in 2 to 3 days if you just sit down and do it but if you don't do it then you know you didn't do the time create a real Kindle book in 90 minutes to create a nice look in the book in 90 minutes is very possible with technology and strategy if you know what you're doing the second way to present time is saying how long it takes you to teach them how to get the prize for example how to improve your golf swing into 30-minutes how to improve your English in 1-hour give me 17 minutes and I'll show you start a conversation with the most beautiful woman in the the time in Canada be how long it takes for them to do it or how long it takes you to teach the part 4 of a profitable product promise is the eliminate the Eliminator let him off the hook as in it's not their fault they don't have what they want everyone puts at mental barriers about what's stopping them such as stumbling blocks are obstacles are painful actions or they don't know the next step for the other or other proceed barriers holding them whether the real or imagined these are real barriers to them it's going to take too long costume much be too hard and they don't know what to do if your on eliminate the excuse that holds them back then you're screwed and they're not in a bag because they'll get up pissing in defence remember that you never say it's therefore let me repeat that under no circumstances do you tell them it is there fault for not getting the results they want yeah I know the reason many people can't lose weight is because they don't have enough sense to push back from the table before they get their cheeseburger but I won't tell them that I will tell them it's not your fault because you've been lied to about how carbs and proteins and vegetables in a rat and if you're just change your strategy for how you eat you will start losing when it comes to sales copy it's not there fat burner into your brain and I had somebody and talk about this as an aside had somebody give me some crappy other day about you know you shouldn't say things about that because you not be person I was I was super fat I was like super fat in 40 and was massively overweight and managed to lose £60 so I'm allowed to since I was 1 and I can say things like that the reason I was that because I didn't have enough sense to push myself back from the table after the third cheeseburger and I thought Greece was a bit so there you go your heart condition picture of health condition without getting out of breath so yes I can make fun of my past self or pouring out where I was screwing up so and sometimes if you got a hammer people but you don't hear more people personally in the sales cap unit never ever ever ever therefore that's why you you sister like on TV I don't know if you pay attention to the ads I do cos I'm out ornament stop but they use words like get rid of your diet that have you seen that one still get rid of your diet resistant fat in other words that that is nobody spotlights diet resistant the other reason that you can't seem to lose weight no matter how much you work out how much you diet is because you have become insulin resistant that is that that's the other one is some about your insulin resistant all of which for some people is probably true but what it is is it letting people off the hook itslearning people who don't have that problem off the hook and it it's just is what it is you gotta let him off the hook so that they can release that past pain and maybe this time they actually get result so I'm not saying that like it's it's a bad thing to let somebody out the hook sometimes there Hangouts overpass failure is what's keeping them from being able to move forward and so but whatever you focus on explains what you and your mind is your reality so if your reality and your lads going to I I can't lose weight I because I've tried I can't quit smoking you know tried exercising I don't have that kind of a body I'll never lose all this way that kind of thing then the cat so you gotta let him off the hook it's and that's saying this like it's manipulative it's just the way people's Minds so time back and maybe that was a little bit also I guessed I'm outside and that was also part of that love me hate me there's no money in the middle mean I'll talk about myself my own behaviour in staff and cut myself no sleep timer for real this time does last were the formula forces you to make a better offer you have to remove what's holding the person back in order to get the sale and when you remove what's

underperform look at the headline do you have a headline you'll be surprised how many people don't have a headline why in the world would anybody not have a headline is the first thing somebody sees on your page you can also be the first words that come out of your mouth and a video sales letter you'll be surprised how many people don't have anything even remotely resembling a headlight is your

my house when the time did mine came that I promise to stop selling the product I was bombed out my wife passed what's wrong I said I've got a perfect offer and a great product Never Again to keep my integrity I had respect the time deadline and never sell the product I learnt my lesson when I came out with my next big product I did not use time deadlines or limited quantities instead I use the fear of losing out which is a much better reason for them to buy now that product ended up making around $5000000 because I wasn't stupid enough to depend on the time deadline it takes a little more skill that come up with but if you can incorporate the fear of losing out in your copy then you do much better things like time deadlines in limited quantities you can do a lot better for a lot longer is there an emotional driver in the car do you have an emotional grab people right at the beginning of your carpet can be fear Desire seriously pain pleasure satisfaction or dissatisfaction when you talk about problems there has to be a motion in fused in your copy you created by circumstances they either want to get rid or wanna create your copy that drives them towards something they want or

look at other people's cells can be their emails and look to see wow overhead line or that headline connoisseur or the first words that come out their mouth and for the first minute they thought I have no clue what's going on here why should be paying attention so this is now this particular secret that we just covered it is literally taking these other secrets and turning it into what amounts to a checklist the troubleshooting guide hope you apply that so definitely I did that on purpose what gave you the idea to give it the title lipstick on a pig because that's a classic southern saying for everything's ok I will tell you that what I've heard that saying before but it was it was a commercial for either metatrader one of these you know invest yourself places and they were selling a gangster stockbrokers and sell the commercial was show this really CD open with this green Outlook and no offence to the guidos butter guido looking guy who was given this big talk and tell him go

boiler room saying Dales I was going to start with me so serious I didn't I wasn't aware it was a sudden saying over the years yeah ok putting lipstick on the pig I always thought of it in the terms of selling something but ok ready for one more but still high CK number 24 should I join the Dark Side I am your daughter has one side can I create Desire for a product it can only take the hopes dreams fears and desires that already exist in the hearts of millions of people and focus their already existing desires into a particular product it is the copywriters Task not to create this mass design but you channel and Direct that from Eugene schwartz master of copying advertising there two ways you can go negative with your copywriting there's one good way and one bad way the good way to go negativas to meet people in their internal conversation you talk about their problems their mistakes their fears and their enemies real or perceived you warn against adverse events and advice use the negative going on inside their head to get in sick with them because once you get in sync with them they will pay attention to me but until you sync with them they won't pay attention to you let's look at a couple of examples what problems would dog trainers have perhaps getting more clients and negative could be are you having trouble attracting good clients for your dog training business are you dealing with problem customers you lead with the negative whiteness how about real estate investors what negatives could you leave with having trouble finding good deals having trouble with no money for down payment you have bad credit is bad credit holding you back from finding your financing your deals can you find deals but you can't find any way to find diesel negatives you can use to enter the conversation going on in somebody's me about doctor's has malpractice insurance crashed your profitability and that's something to think about maybe a doctor has staffing problems may be a doctor has issues with patient satisfaction sorry have a problem have a problem with health insurance not paying out on time or cutting your fees how about bohac taking a traffic ads not converting trouble getting all the Mechanic setup for your fans use the negative to get in sync with somebody once you get in sync with them then you transition to your solution nobody cares about your answer until they know you care about their problem is an addicts that says nobody cares how much you know until they know how much you care are you may think that's an old tired worn out phrase but it is as valid now as it has ever been especially with online sales copy roadmap or inoculate them against future adverse event those are all excellent negatives to include in your copywriting content and communication there like public service announcements you can think about it this way I'm helping you avoid problems I'm happy to overcome Road back I'm answering the questions that are holding you back your performing a public service for your target audience whether it's do yourself happy cafe riding video or contact that's the good way to go negative use the bad to get in sync with where your potential customer is right now now let's look at the negative negative and by the way and negative negative does not make a positive the best example of what not to do is any political attack ads you've ever seen this adds the call names and Frodo create a toxic environment for everyone you might I would never do that in my business that's wonderful but I have seen people do this and it's detriment barman you never outright attack somebody you can attack behaviour if you see something that somebody is doing so you know I've seen people doing this this and I don't think it's right here's why in what people should do instead you can attack results if they don't make sense or could ultimately hurt them for example chiropractor see somebody teaching a patient to do a particular exercise that would injure somebody then you should bring that to people's attention you can also attack a message why would you keep doing things the way they did in the last century when we had advances in technology and strategy that make it 100 x 100 x easier to get results so stop doing things the old way start doing things the new you can attack behaviour you can attack results you can attack a method but you never attack a person or a company by name you never ever call somebody out it now kaiser it only creates problems and it will come back and bite you 99 times out of 100 now here's what we don't mean by night going naked that sounds like a triple negative we don't mean that everything is super positive there's a Disney character name Pollyanna positive about everything she would no matter what anyone said find the positive spin on it she was so sickly sweet I want to reach to the screen and choker this group fell about third story window broker back and was still positive about everything is there a cheerleader away at the end of the movie so we don't want to phone the trap of Everything's always pass because that won't resonate with people what if you're in a situation where you must compare and contrast yourself with someone else especially if somebody is doing something that is not in people's best interests you want to say something like this now celebrate competitors will tell black but that's just not hear the facts you need to know you don't mention anybody buy name Branston competitors will tell you it's ok to use a choke chain when training a large dog but that's not true hear the facts you need to know about competitors will tell you to use a third-party email service provider to send your email but that's not a good idea here are the facts you need to know some of our competitors would tell you that they have great deliverability rates just like us but that's not true you're the facts you need the song this is a way you can sweep the legs out from under them without mentioning anyone by name or calling them you say you know this is not true where you can say something like you may have noticed some people are black but we don't think that's right here's why you may have noticed that some people charge extra for black but we don't think that's right here's why you may have never said some people make you pay for a separate III email relay service but we don't think that's right here's why you kill the message out there but your sweeping it out of the way and saying what you think is essential for them to make a good decision which is the buy from you whenever your target audiences experience you can cheat in on a negative would that mean confrontational or combative or attacking someone by name remember you can go naked it without joining the dark side by using the negative to get in sync with people you can always attacked behaviour the idea or practice but never ever name names summary there's a good in a bad way to go naked use negatives to get in single people in the conversations going on in their heads never go negative by attacking someone or company my name never pays off and it very often backfires little secret number 24 great advice thank you yes I think that's great advice it in plastic waste a lot did you go on negative yes but like for the fitness industry for the fitness industry Avenue Cannock about training methods if you see somebody teaching something that's complete bullocks as the is the Brits like to say you can say hey there some people out there telling you to do this and I'm an explain to you why that's a really bad idea and can end up not only hurting you but actually crashing your dreams of becoming an ABC or firefighter or whatever and people go oh damn I better pay attention and you just never ever names because she start naming names there's some jackalope that has an attorney or an attorney that wants to try and make a name for themselves and they just start doing stupid stuff and I learn this back in 2005 when I was doing my Friday Night Smackdown thing and I did not attack person but I attacked a behaviour that someone who was very well known in the industry was engaging in and it created a Firestorm that could have resulted in a very nasty lawsuit luckily I followed my own advice and did not name names but I learnt some lessons about how to let other people that the best thing you can do is bring the negative to their attention in such a way that you are perceived as the calm cool expert Voice of Reason and the customer gets pissed off at the person or thing they know that you're talking about literally not talking about on so that's how you know that that's the next level up of that is that you are just you're the Voice of Reason and the more reasonable you are the more pissed off the customers getting at the third party that you're trying to getting pissed off at anyway yeah I actually answered one like that yesterday you're so messy what's the difference between your Planet X Y Z playing and I said well I'm doing it for 20 years they have not I will tell you this though I have a way to train not the way the train and I know because I've been doing this for 20-years that my way work I do not know if they works or not it could bigger is better that's a good one you want you one more I was do one more
